 * the spell and the target.  A bad roll will show the spell garbled and
 * then an INT check for the target.  If a really bad roll is made, the spell
 * will be replaced by an incorrect one.  the heart of this system is
 * start_chant(), end_chant, and bad_guess().

 * both mobs and PCs.  LOts of code was touched and many errors were fixed.
 * MCLASS_VOID was moved from 13 to -1 to match CLASS_UNDEFINED for PC's.
 * MObs now get random skill/spell/language levels baseed on their
 *race/class/level that exactly align with PC's.  PC's no longer have to rent to
 *use skills gained by leveling or when first creating a char.  Languages no
 *longer reset to defaults when a PC levels.  Discovered that languages have
 *been defined right in the middle of the spell area.  This needs to be fixed.
 *A conversion util neeDs to be run on the mob files to compensate for the 13 to
 *-1 class change.
 * --gurlaek 7/6/1999

 * Revision 1.17  1999/06/30 18:11:09  jimmy
 * act.offensive.c    config.c      handler.c    spells.c
 * This is a major conversion from the 18 point attribute system to the
 * 100 point attribute system.  A few of the major changes are:
 * All attributes are now on a scale from 0-100
 * Everyone views attribs the same but, the attribs for one race
 *   may be differeent for that of another even if they are the
 *   same number.
 * Mobs attribs now get rolled and scaled using the same algorithim as PC's
 * Mobs now have individual random attributes based on race/class.
 * The STR_ADD attrib has been completely removed.
 * All bonus tables for attribs in constants.c have been replaced by
 *   algorithims that closely duplicate the tables except on a 100 scale.
 * Some minor changes:
 * Race selection at char creation can now be toggled by using
 *   <world races off>
 * Lots of cleanup done to affected areas of code.
 * Setting attributes for mobs in the .mob file no longer functions
 *   but is still in the code for later use.
 * We now have a spare attribut structure in the pfile because the new
 *   system only used three instead of four.
