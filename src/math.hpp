/*
 * normal_random
 *
 * Generates a random value based on the normal distribution centered at Avg
 * with standard deviation std.  NOTE: Technically, a normal distribution
 * extends to infinity in both directions.  However, to make this plausible in
 * game terms we cap the distribution at 3 standard-deviations in either
 * direction.  IE - if a magic missile is supposed to do an average of 12
 * damage, with standard-deviation of 2, it will never do less than
 * 12 - 2 * 3 = 6, and never do more than 12 + 2*3 = 18.
 *
 * avg - The average value we should give out.
 * std - The standard deviation of the distribution.
 *
 * Returns - a random value.
