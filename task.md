- Object/name namelists should not be shown to the player.  Lets rename 'name' to 'namelist' to help distinguish this.  This is a list of names that we can interact with the entity by.
- We should usually only see the short_description.  (Unless we look at an object/mob, then we should see the full description.)
- Objects are being spawned in the main room.  (for example, items that it looks like should be sold by the baker.)
- Look at gmcp.  We send it once at login, but never again.  It should be sent when vitals change or when we enter a new room.
- Once it all looks good.  Continue with our @PLAN.md
- Update this file so it's ready for the next run and we know what to do next.
