! ^
 
Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.
 
Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string. The 
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"
 
Examples:
 
  > tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
  No-one by that name here.
 
  > ^rasmusse^rasmussen
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'
 
  > ^you^you doing^
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

ABORT
 
Usage: abort
 
Prematurely terminates the casting of a spell. If you have reason to 
believe that a spell, already in the process of casting, will not be 
needed, you can ABORT it.

#0
AC
 
The lower your character's AC (acronym for "Armor Class"), the less 
chance he or she will have of getting injured in battle. Armor class 
numbers often run into the negatives (good!) and it is not uncommon for 
an extremely high-level player to have -100 AC.
 
Examples:
   100          Naked person
     0          Heavily armored
   -51          Very heavily armored
  -100          Nigh-nonhittable
 
The help entry under THAC0 further explains this hit/miss system.

AFK
 
Usage: toggle afk
 
When you are AFK, you are telling the world that you are Away From your 
Keyboard and won't be around to interact with anyone who tries to talk to 
you. Turning on the AFK flag appends (AFK) to your title and prompt.
  
There is also an AFK social that simply emotes to the room that you are 
stepping away from your computer for a moment.

AGGR
 
Usage: aggr <hitpoints>
       aggr off
 
Sets your aggressiveness to monsters. When the value is greater than 0 
and you're in good health, you will attack mobiles that are aggressive to 
you. It's checked whenever you enter a room.
 
When your hit points are below the AGGR value, or below the current 
WIMPY setting, you won't be aggressive.
 
See also: TOGGLE, CONSIDER
#0
AGGRO AGGRESSIVE
 
"Aggro" is an abbreviation for aggressive, usually describing mobiles 
that will attack players unprovoked. Players may also use the AGGR 
command to pre-emptively auto-attack mobiles.

#0
ALERT
 
FieryMUD has multiple positions of resting. Although it's not fully 
implemented you can be resting while standing. When this happens you will 
be unable to do many things, like move, participate in combat etc... If 
you find yourself in this odd state, type ALERT to make yourself more 
alert.
 
See also: STAND, REST, RECLINE, SLEEP
#0
ALIAS ALIASES
 
Usage: alias [alias name] [command]
 
An ALIAS is a single command used to represent one or more other 
commands. The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's 
aliases. Type ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined 
aliases.
 
  > alias
 
Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new ALIAS. The ALIAS name 
must be one word. The command can be any string. ALIASES may not be 
nested or used recursively. Any command may be overridden by an ALIAS 
(other than the ALIAS command itself, of course).
 
  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse
 
Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an ALIAS that has already been defined.
 
  > alias gbb
 
A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with 
a single ALIAS. This supports ALIASES, not scripting entire routines. It 
should be noted, Mudlet requires TWO ; for this to work, as it also uses 
; to separate commands.
 
  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread
 
Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat ALIAS is interpreted as the 
MUD's internal EAT command; ALIASES may not be nested or used 
recursively. The variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent 
arguments given with an ALIAS.
 
Examples:
 
  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage
 
Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage. Variables 
may be used repeatedly and in any order:
 
  > alias helpem cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1
 
The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an ALIAS:
 
  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

ALIGNMENT
 
A character's alignment is their standing in the moral grounds of good 
and evil. Some subclasses such as ranger require a certain alignment in 
order for their spells to work (in this case, good) and many items 
require their holder to be of a certain alignment to use the item.
 
You can determine your alignment with the SCORE command. The numeric 
value ranges from -1000 to 1000, with the following meanings:
 
1000 to 350: Good
349 to -349: Neutral
-350 to -1000: Evil

"ANIMATE DEAD"
 
===============================================
Usage         : cast 'animate dead' <corpse>
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : n/a
Effect        : summoning
Area of effect: target
Duration      : 27 - 57 hours
Sphere        : death
Classes       : Necromancer    Circle 3
===============================================
 
ANIMATE DEAD is a necromancer's power base. Though a low circle, it is 
the spell they will use continually for their entire career. ANIMATE
DEAD will bring undead of various types into the realm based on the
necromancer's level and the level of the corpse it is cast on. A
necromancer's Charisma is used to help control the animated corpse: a
caster with a higher Charisma will have a much better chance of having
powerful creatures not turning on him or her. The hitpoints of the newly
animated undead will also be in part determined by the hitpoints of the
necromancer, so that a necromancer with better hit points will animate
corpses that will have more HP than a necromancer of the same level who
has fewer HP.
 
All raised creatures will eventually crumble into dust, but their
existence can be prolonged by casting PRESERVE on the corpse before
animating it. Necromancers use vast amounts of concentration to maintain
control over their undead minions. As a result a necromancer can only
control so many at once of varying strength levels. Some undead will be
raised and free themselves from the control of their master immediately,
turning on everyone in sight. If you see a horde of undead without a
master, just run.

#0
ANONYMOUS
 
Usage: toggle anonymous
 
This is a toggle that allows players level 50 and over to hide their
class and level from view of the general population, simply displaying
-Anon- on the WHO list. If someone is anonymous then they have chosen
not to show their skills to the world at large.
 
See also: WHO, TOGGLE
#0
ANSI COLOR

Usage: color [off | sparse | normal | complete]

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you 
see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color sparse
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels. Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY 
slightly. The effect is more noticeable on slower connections. Even if 
you have color turned on, uncolored messages will not be slowed down at 
all.

ANTIPALADIN ANTI-PALADIN "ANTI PALADIN"
 
   Anti-paladins are the essence of evil embodied. These unholy warriors 
have made dark pacts with the forces of Chaos and Destruction, which give 
them special powers. Anti-paladins seek the complete annihilation of 
good, and revel in pain, chaos, and destruction. They have been known to 
be able to harm with a simple touch, and fight with incredible bloodlust. 
They are often seen riding jet black unearthly mounts that resemble 
horses. Anti-paladins are granted the ability to sense good in the world 
around them and are granted a degree of protection from it.
 
Primary Attributes:   Strength, Constitution, Wisdom
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all), Duergar, Human, Orc, 
Innate Skills:        Layhands (harming)
 
Experience to Level:  Above average
 
     *Note:  Anti-Paladins are a subclass of warrior and, as with all 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

"APOCALYPTIC ANTHEM"
 
===============================================
Usage          : chant 'apocalyptic anthem'
Area of Effect : Room
Aggressive     : yes
Accumulative   : no
Duration       : Proficiency
Classes        : Monk           Level 75
===============================================
 
The anthem of the apocalypse stirs up feelings of hatred, confusing the 
monk's opponents and causing them to preferentially attack the monk. This 
is a quest chant.

AREA AREAS ZONES
 
This is a list of the major areas in Fiery. The most important thing 
about an area is its level range. The ranges listed here are estimates 
based on a group with 2-4 characters, for the most part. As you get above 
level 80, larger groups are often necessary.
 
Fighting in towns and cities is usually a very bad idea, as the guards  
will assist against you - no matter what you may be fighting.

ASSASSINS
 
   Assassins are trained killers, and while they may not be the 
strongest or toughest of adversaries, their knowledge of anatomy, 
weapons, and poisons makes them a feared hand of death in the realms. 
Assassins are generally evil, killing for their own gains, but some are 
even neutral and do it only for the work, taking no special pleasure in 
death itself. The stealth of a trained assassin can make them seem to 
have faded from reality completely, yet reappear behind you with daggers 
in hand, and all without an ounce of magic.
 
Primary Attributes:   Dexterity, Constitution
Allowed Races:        Duergar, Human, Orc, Sverfneblin
 
Experience to Level:  Average
 
     *Note:  Assassins are a subclass of rogue and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

ASSIST

===============================
Usage      : assist <target>
Aggressive : Yes
===============================

This command is used to come to the aid of a particular person, and you 
begin fighting whomever (or whatever) they are fighting. It is useful to 
prevent possibly deadly mistakes if there is more than one of a 
particular opponent in a room.

ATTRIBUTE

&1&bTHIS HELP ENTRY IS OBSOLETE&0
 
Usage: attribute
 
This command will show you a listing of your character's basic stats -- 
Str, Int, Wis, Dex, Con, Cha, AC, hit and damroll, alignment, etc.
Though these are also shown in SCORE, ATTRIBUTE will show you your
natural Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, and Cha. It will look something
like this:
 
Str: 100(91)    Int: 96(91)    Wis: 100(93)
Dex: 81(86)    Con: 66(63)    Cha: 53(50)
 
The number in parenthesis is your natural score. The number outside
the parenthesis is what it's being modified to by spells, equipment,
etc.
 
Characters below level 15 will only be able to see "Fantastic",
"Pretty Good", "Not bad", "Fair", and "Bad" rather than numbers.
 
Characters below 35 will only be able to see their alignment
as good, neutral or evil. Once they get past 35, numbers will
become visible. At 35, they will also become able to see their
hitroll, damroll and saves in vague terms such as "Bad", "Fair", etc.
 
At level 50, characters will be able to see their Armor Class (AC)
in numbers as well.
 
At level 75, a character can see their hitroll, damroll and
saving throws in numbers.
 
Note that different attribute scores may look the same on members
of different races, but in practice they will actually be quite
different. A human's 100 Str is not the same as a barbarian's
100 Str, but that same human's 70 Int will be more than the
barbarian's 70 Int.

AUTOBOOT REBOOT

Usage:
  autoboot off           - disable automatic reboot
  autoboot on            - enable automatic reboot
  autoboot warntime <mn> - warnings begin <mn> minutes before reboot
  autoboot [<hr>][:<mn>] - reboot in <hr> hours, <mn> minutes
  autoboot postpone      - postpone reboot for double warntime minutes

Fiery will normally reboot itself periodically. When it starts up, it 
decides when the next reboot will occur. The autoboot command can be used 
to adjust and control this behavior. During the final two minutes before 
an automatic reboot, mortal logins will be disabled.

"autoboot warntime" is used to set the warning time. Reboot warnings will 
begin this amount of time prior to the reboot.

"autoboot postpone" is used to delay an automatic reboot. It can be used 
by lower-level deities. It will work if the automatic reboot is imminent 
- in other words, if warnings have started. It will cause the reboot to
be delayed for 2x(warning time). For example, if the warning time were
set to 15 minutes, and the reboot was 5 minutes away, issuing "autoboot 
postpone" would cause the reboot to be canceled and set to occur in 30 
minutes.

A single number will be interpreted as a number of hours: "autoboot 14" 
would set the reboot to happen in 14 hours. A colon may be used to 
indicate minutes: "autoboot 2:30" will cause a reboot in 2.5 hours. The 
hours may be omitted. To cause the reboot in 4 minutes, enter "autoboot 
:4".

#100
AUTOEXIT
 
Usage: toggle autoexit
 
Toggles the automatic display of currently available exits. Not all 
possible exits will be displayed, only those immediately available. If a 
door is closed it will show up as a possible exit, but noted with a '#'. 
For instance, you might see -E# -N. In this example, a door is closed to 
the east and there is an open exit to the north. Autoexits won't show you 
hidden doors or exits.
 
See also: TOGGLE, SEARCH
#0
AUTOINVIS

Usage: toggle autoinvis [ on | off | <level> ]

This TOGGLE controls immortals' invisibility levels as they enter the 
game. It can be set to any value between 0 and your level, inclusive. 
Your invisibility level will be set to that value as you enter the game, 
before any messages or notifications are sent out.

Setting it to "on" will set your AUTOINVIS level to the maximum possible 
value: your level. Setting it "off" will prevent the mud from modifying 
your invisibility level as you enter the game. The value -1 is the same 
as off.

See also: TOGGLE
#100
AUTOLOOT

Usage: toggle autoloot

TOGGLE the automatic looting of corpses when you kill an opponent. When
AUTOLOOT is TOGGLED on, you will execute an implicit 'get all corpse' 
when you land the killing blow.

If you want to loot coins and treasure, but not items, turn this TOGGLE
off and use the AUTOTREAS toggle instead.

See also: TOGGLE, AUTOSPLIT, AUTOTREAS
#0
AUTOSPLIT

Usage: toggle autosplit

TOGGLE the automatic splitting of coins when they are picked up from a 
corpse. When you have AUTOSPLIT TOGGLED on, whenever you pick up coins 
from a corpse and you are in a group, you will automatically split the 
coins you picked up among your group. If you are grouped and 
automatically pick up coins from a corpse via AUTOLOOT, you will split 
the coins if AUTOSPLIT is TOGGLED on.

See also: TOGGLE, AUTOLOOT, AUTOTREAS, GROUP, SPLIT
#0
AUTOTREAS

Usage: toggle autotreas

TOGGLE automatic looting of treasure. This TOGGLE causes you to
take all coins and treasure from the corpses of creatures you've
just killed. Unlike AUTOLOOT, it doesn't cause you to take other
items.

The AUTOLOOT TOGGLE overrides this one. If they are both on, you
will take all objects from your kills.

BACKSTAB

=========================================
Usage      : backstab [<victim>]
Aggressive : yes
Classes    : Assassin       Level 1
           : Mercenary      Level 10
           : Rogue          Level 1
           : Thief          Level 1
=========================================

A BACKSTAB is an attempt to sneak up on the victim and place a weapon in 
the victim's back, at exactly the point where it will do the most damage. 
The amount of damage incurred is dependent on the proficiency of the 
backstabber and the strength of the weapon.

You may only BACKSTAB with piercing weapons, like daggers. Assassins with 
enough proficiency in dual wield may double-backstab if wielding two 
piercing weapons.

#0
BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the 
site substring from logging in to the game. You may ban a site to ALL, 
NEW or SELECT players. Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new 
players from registering. Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY 
connections from that site. Banning a site SELECTively allows only 
players with site-ok flags to log in from that site. Ban with no argument 
returns a list of currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

 IT IS ESSENTIAL YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE INTERNET IS SUBDIVIDED BEFORE YOU  
 BAN LARGE NETS OF ADDRESSES WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE DOING, BAD BAD.

So, how is the internet subdivided?  We won't go into CIDR blocking here
but it is essential you understand that if you ban network 4. you just
prevented 16,777,216 possible addresses from playing on FieryMUD.

IP addresses are divided up into 4 sets of 8 bits (8, octet, get it?) in 
the format w.x.y.z The value of w x and/or y will determine what size 
network the player is originating from. The internet is divided up into 
classes based on these sizes. The are referred to as Class A, Class B, 
and Class C. Other classes exist but aren't relevant to play on FieryMUD.

Without going into bit-wise explanation of the divisions the following 
table defines the classes.

      Class         Networks
        A     1.0.0.0     -  126.0.0.0
        B     128.0.0.0   -  192.167.0.0
        C     192.168.0.0 +

 The size of a class A netblock is 16,777,216 possible addresses.
 The size of a class B netblock is 65,536 possible addresses. 
 The size of a class C netblock is 256 possible addresses.

So, when you ban someone try to ban their IP individually. If they are 
some dynamic addressed dialup, and come back to cause trouble, ban them 
based on a class C subnet size.
 
Example:

     Doofus needs banning and he's playing from 004.234.055.011.
 
   Ban him based on his IP and disconnected him. If he returns in a
   few minutes with the IP address of 004.234.055.233 then it's fairly
   safe to assume that he's getting dynamic addresses from his dialup
   connection. SO:
 
     Doofus gets banned on 004.234.055 using just the first 3 octets.

Allegedly, we have this limited octet covering entire nets and subnets 
working. So this is a sound strategy. Remember when you ban 3 octets you 
are just preventing 256 (254 really) addresses from playing. Note that it 
is an unfortunate side effect that valid users will be blocked when we 
ban people. That's what the gods list is for. 

NEVER EVER BAN JUST THE FIRST ONE OR TWO OCTETS ONLY. NEVER EVER EVER 
EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER 
EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER 
EVER EVER EVER EVER BAN ANY IP ADDRESS STARTING WITH 127.x.y.z, or 
163.246.y.z EVER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                            I MEAN IT!

BARDS
      This class has yet to be implemented.
   Bards are performers of incredible skill, as well as con artists of 
equal skill. Many bards are not as selfish as most rogues, preferring 
their musical craft over pick-pocketing. Bards are often seen 
accompanying the forces of good, lending their songs of courage and hope, 
and utilizing their abilities to pick locks. Some call bards hopeless 
romantics, caught up in their ballads, but any bard will tell you 
differently, pointing out that not everyone cares only for themselves. 

   The influence a bard has over others is truly amazing. They have the 
ability to read a crowd and alter the emotions of that crowd. Bards have 
been known, in fact, to boost the morale of soldiers to incredible  
heights, casting their own enchantment on those that hear their songs of
bravery, peace, love, and heroism.

Primary Attributes:   Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma
Allowed Races:        Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-Elf, Halfling, Human,
                      Sverfneblin
 
Experience to Level:  Greatly Above Average

     *Note:  Bards are a subclass of Rogue and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

This is a monk's proficiency at attacking others without a weapon. Type 
skill for information on proficiency level.

    You do the damage of a nekkid piece of cheese.
    You do the damage of a small sword.
    You do the damage of a flaming claymore.

If a monk is holding or wielding anything in either hand then the 
BAREHAND advantage is negated and they will hit worse than sorcerers.

friends and allies of the caster. It does not combine with other types of 
armor spells.

BASH
 
================================================
Usage      : bash [<victim>]
Aggressive : yes
Classes    : Anti-Paladin   Level 1
           : Mercenary      Level 1
           : Paladin        Level 1
           : Ranger         Level 1
           : Warrior        Level 1
================================================
 
BASH is an attempt to use a shield to knock someone over that person 
over. The success of a BASH depends upon how experienced you are. If you 
succeed, you will inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on 
its rear. The victim will be unable to fight or issue any commands for a 
few rounds of combat. If you miss, you lose your balance and fall and 
suffer similar penalties from being in the prone position.
 
Regardless of success or failure, BASH will make you unable to type 
commands for a couple rounds of combat, including fleeing.
 
Note that bashing a person who is resting/sitting will inflict more 
damage. A successful BASH will stop someone from casting a spell.
 
You can only BASH a mob within one size category of yourself. Dragons are 
immune to bashing.
 
Some races and classes have similar skills. Large races, such as 
barbarians, ogres, and trolls, have BODYSLAM. Monks have SPRINGLEAP.

"BATTLE HOWL" HOWL
 
================================================
Usage      : howl
Aggressive : yes

================================================
 
Initiated with the HOWL command, BATTLE HOWL unleashes the delirious 
terror of the wolf. The berserker causes enemies to flee or fall over 
just as they might when faced with a dragon or a demon’s roar. Battle 
howl can only be used while berserking and under the influence of 
spirit of the wolf.

The reminder serves as an incentive to hit the enemy all the more,
making their physical attack all the more probable.

BERSERK
 
================================================
Usage      : berserk
Aggressive : no
Classes    : Berserker      Level 10
================================================
 
BERSERK is the berserker's primary and most important skill. It allows a 
character to build up rage and, more importantly, enter an enraged 
berserker trance. Higher proficiencies in berserking causes rage to 
build up more quickly. By itself, the berserker trance causes the user 
to deal and take 10% more damage for normal attacks, but also causes 
the berserker to automatically be aggressive to otherwise non-peaceful 
NPCs. Many of the berserker's other skills require the user to be in a 
berserk trance in order to be successful.

BERSERKER
 
   Berserkers are warriors that have learned to harness their rage and 
call upon it in combat to enhance their abilities. When in a berserk 
rage, they will not be able to recognize friend from foe and often end 
up attacking others without provocation. The look in the eyes of an 
enraged Berserker is said to be very haunting, and often the last 
sight you do see.
 
Primary Attributes:   Strength, Constitution
Allowed Races:        Barbarian, Duergar, Dwarf, Ogre, Orc, Troll
 
Experience to Level:  Above Average
 
   *Note:  Berserkers are a subclass of warrior and, as with all other
           subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
           degree of experience and locating the subclass quest master.

Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : generic
Classes       : Sorcerer       Circle 7
===============================================
 
This powerful spell causes a huge magical fist, five feet high, three 
feet wide, to form before the caster. The fist strikes out at the victim 
with a mighty blow, smashing into its target with dreadful force. The 
damage sustained by the target is not just from the crushing blow, but 
also from a vicious shock wave that follows.

BIND UNBIND

THIS COMMAND HAS BEEN DISABLED OR REMOVED

Usage: bind <victim>
       unbind <victim>

Will, as it says, BIND or UNBIND somebody. You must be holding some rope 
for this to work. While bound, the victim can't move or type most

After unbinding the victim, the rope disappears. Bug or feature?

BLESS
 
===============================================
Usage         : cast 'bless' [<target | weapon>]
Min. position : sitting
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : enchantment
Area of effect: target
Accumulative  : no
Duration      : 10 - 24 hours (char); permanent (weapon)

              : Paladin        Circle 1
              : Priest         Circle 2
===============================================
 
Casting BLESS on a target will improve the target's saving throw versus 
spells and furthermore improve their ability to strike a target with 
physical contact.
 
A blessed character may attack ethereal creatures normally. A blessed
weapon may be used to attack them as well. However, only rather plain
weapons can be blessed. Evil persons may not use blessed weapons.

BLINDNESS
 
===============================================
Usage         : cast 'blindness' [<victim>]

              : Diabolist      Circle 4
              : Priest         Circle 4
===============================================
 
BLINDNESS will blind a victim failing its saving throw. While blinded a 
creature will not be able to direct any activity at another being. 
Spells, attacks, socials.... There are exceptions to this of course. 
BLINDNESS can be cured by a spectrum of various healing spells. A blinded 
person will have a penalty to both hitroll and AC.

BLUR
 
===============================================
Usage         : cast 'blur'
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : yes
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : support

              : return to normal speed.
Classes       : Ranger         Circle 11 (quest)
===============================================
 
BLUR significantly heightens a person's senses, improving his or her 
reaction time and speed for the duration of the spell. This effect is 
especially evident in combat, where users are known to gain two to three 
additional attacks per melee round. BLUR is an advanced ranger spell, and 
as such may only be attained via questing.
 
Voices whisper in darkened forests. Enmity lingers through death and 
curses. Bringing swift peace to the forest may catch the attention of 
those capable of teaching greater skills.

BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD. 
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board. Type
"WRITE BOARD <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message
with a '/s' as the first character on a line. Type "READ <number>" to 
read a post. Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

You can also use "EDIT <number>" to edit messages you've already posted.

Type "/h" to get help while in the board message editor.

BOAT

A boat is needed to cross deep water. There is no trick to using boats - 
the only requirement is to carry one in your inventory.

Boats are available in various places. Newer players may find that 
sorcerers are reliable sources of boats due to the "minor creation" spell, 
which can be used to create a raft. The drawback of the raft is that it's 
rather heavy.

Flying makes boats unnecessary.

BODYSLAM
 
================================================
Usage      : bodyslam [<victim>]
Aggressive : yes
Races      : Barbarian      Innate
           : Ogre           Innate
           : Troll          Innate
================================================
 
BODYSLAM is an innate skill available to larger races, such as 
barbarians, ogres, and trolls. Its effect is similar to BASH, knocking 
the victim to the ground and causing minor damage and preventing him/her 
from making any kind of action, including combat, for a short amount of 
time if successful. A successful BODYSLAM will stop someone from casting 
a spell. If you fail a BODYSLAM, you will instead be unable to fight 
back.
 
Unlike BASH, BODYSLAM can be used without a shield. BODYSLAM can only 
initiate combat; it can not be used if you are already in combat like 
bash or backstab.
 
BODYSLAM can only be used against mobs within one size category of 
yourself. Dragons cannot be knocked down by BODYSLAM.

Duration      : 8 - 48 hours
Sphere        : protection
Fade message  : &3Your skin returns to normal.&0
Classes       : Necromancer    Circle 4
===============================================
 
This spell causes old bones to leap out of the ground and surround the
necromancer, acting as a protective shell and adding to the caster's 
armor. BONE ARMOR does not combine with other armor spells.

BREATH BREATHE
 
Usage: breathe <energy>
 
BREATHE allows demons, dragons, and dragonborn to breathe their natural 
element at all targets in the room. Damage increases as skill proficiency 
increases.
 
Like most other skills, trainers can help improve player skill 
proficiency for a fee.

For players, BREATHE has a cooldown of 5 minutes. BREATHE cannot be used 
in anti-magic rooms.
 
See also: DRAGONBORN
#0
BRIEF
 
Usage: toggle brief
 
When in BRIEF mode, you don't see the descriptions of the room you are in 
when you move; only the name of the room and the people and objects 
there. Unless you're very familiar with the area in which you're 
traveling, it is not advisable to use this command. Frequently, you will 
find small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra 
peek at your surroundings could mean the difference between life and 
death!
 
If you explicitly type 'look', you will always see the full room 
description, even in BRIEF mode.
 
See also: COMPACT, LOOK, TOGGLE

BRUTAL VICIOUS

Usage: toggle vicious

This will compel you to kill any mobs you mortally wound in a fight. Very

BUG TYPO IDEA

For making useful suggestions and reporting problems to the Powers that Be.

Examples:

  > bug some of Proky's code doesn't work.
  > idea Make this do that, that would be neat
  > typo Uklor spelled sense 'sence'

BUILD BUILDING BUILDERS

        Once submitted, to FieryMUD or FieryWEB, any concept, 
        idea and the culmination thereof, referred to as work
        or material, becomes property of FieryMUD and will be
        used at sole discretion of the owner of FieryMUD in
        any way shape or form the owner finds appropriate.
        Submission of material or work requires reading of
        appropriate statements and instructions, of which
        this is, in advance of any submission. Therefore
        submission of ideas or concepts is validation of 
        acceptance of this former implicit policy now 
        explicit.

To submit an idea for building an area you must write the story of the 
area outlining its plot and importance to the region or realm. Suggest a 
level range for your potential area in a 30 level block, 20-50, 35-75, 
etc. Explain why the important characters in your area are important. 
Define important objects and what they lend to the plot. 

Be ready to work! We require builders to construct areas in order of 
difficulty. That means your first area will be a newbie area, your next 
area will be a lower level area, next mid level, etc... So if you want to 
build the homeland of hot dragon death area then get ready to build 5 
areas before it.

Do a gut check here and now. Look at the bazillion newbie areas we have 
and how the areas taper off after that. Many people come on to build a 
simple newbie area and learn what degree of work it really entails and 
run for the hills never getting to implement their dream dragon area. If 
you have imagination and motivation this will be the place for you.

Building here on Fiery is rather simple. To make it even easier, this 
help file will give a few tips and rules that should be followed to make 
all the zones on the MUD look uniform. More will be added as time goes 
on.

Rooms:
1) Always capitalize all important words in the room name.
   Example: A Long Tunnel in Darkwood Forest
2) Always leave a three space indentation at the start of every room
   description.

Objects:
1) An object's short description should never contain capitalized letters
   unless they are proper nouns.
   Example: a wicked mace named 'Bone Crusher' or an ivory handled dagger
2) Long descriptions should have the same structure as a proper sentence,
   including first word capitalization and punctuation. Only proper nouns 
   should be capitalized in the long description.
3) An object should have on average an extra description of at least one 
   or two lines in length.
4) Try to keep objects balanced with the zone. Look at other zones or ask 
   for help if you are unsure of item balance.

Mobiles:
1) Mobile short descriptions should not contain any capitalized letters 
   unless they are proper nouns. No ANSI code should be used before the 
   first word of their short description.
2) Mobile long descriptions should be structured like a proper sentence,
   containing no capitalized words except for the first word and any 
   proper nouns.
3) Mobiles should not have unrealistic flags or levels. No level 50 fleas
   or baby orcs with haste and stone skin please.

CHANT one of their songs only once every 4 mud hours, and occasionally 
fail to properly sing the song.
 
Monk CHANTS can enable monks to change their moods and the moods of 
others with their deep resonant voices. The deep and pleasing tones can 
have a variety of effects on the monk and those who are in his vicinity 
depending on the songs chanted.
 
Berserker CHANTS are furious cries which invoke various spirits of 
nature. The chants increase the berserker’s capacity while in battle 
frenzy and give access to additional skills.
 
A list of what a character is capable of chanting is listed by typing 
songs.

CHARACTER

"Character" is Fiery's generic word for a creature, including both players 
and non-player characters like Bigby.

Characters have many important attributes, including:

    LEVEL      A measure of power. With greater levels come
               opportunities for more skills and spells, and
               better equipment.

    CLASS      The chosen profession. It dictates the skills
               and spells (if any), and other physical attributes.

    RACE       The race identifies one's heritage, such as
               human or gnome. Some races have special skills.
               The race controls how high the stats like INT
               and STR may go.

    LIFE FORCE  The life force is the energy that motivates a
               character. It controls vulnerability to certain
               kinds of magic and attacks.

    COMPOSITION  This is what the character's body is made of.
               Usually, characters are composed of flesh. There
               are undead characters made only of bone, elementals
               made of fire or water, and others.

CHARISMA

Charisma is a measure of your appeal, and is not necessarily limited
to your good looks (or your lack of such). Charisma only plays into
a few aspects, including your chance to TAME, the exchange rate you
get at the bank, and your rate of success in ANIMATE DEAD and 
SHAPECHANGE.

Classes       : Sorcerer       Circle 12 (quest)
              : Illusionist    Circle 12 (quest)
===============================================
 
A sorcerer of sufficient power may force their will upon others via this 
spell, completely subjugating the victim. When this spell is in effect on 
a victim, they become unable to perform many actions of their own 
volition and must follow any orders given by the sorcerer. The success of 
casting this spell is dependent on the victim's level and saving throws 
compared to the caster's level.
 
The quest to learn this spell is now in game:
Some dedicate their whole lives to charming and entertaining others. 
Some are even willing to share their knowledge with others - for a 
price. Certain new secrets are available in entertaining houses 
of ill-repute.

              : Sorcerer       Circle 2

opponent and impede their ability to cause physical damage.

light which will allow them and others near them to see when it is dark.

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science. All code unique 
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns 
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another 
throughout the course of its development. Although it's impossible for me 
to remember them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Alex Fletcher (Furry), for single-handedly managing Circle's world 
     files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, and David 
     Carver
     for porting it to OS/2.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementers Dave & 
     Justin, for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- And, of course, Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me 
     sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!

CLAN "CLAN COMMAND"
 
Usage: clan <subcommand> [<parameters>]
 
The CLAN command encapsulates most of the functionality of clans (if you
don't know what they are, see help CLANS). This command allows players to 
join or administrate clans via a number of subcommands. Different 
subcommands are available to different players. Some actions are only 
valid for non-members, and some are limited to privileged clan members. 
For instance, "clan apply" only makes sense for players who are not in a 
clan, while "clan promote" is only available to clan members with that
privilege.
 
The following clan subcommands are available: APPLY, DEMOTE, DEPOSIT, 
ENROLL, EXPEL, INFO, LIST, PROMOTE, QUIT, REJECT, SET, STATUS, TELL, WHO,
and WITHDRAW. Usage and additional help for each subcommand can be found
by typing "help clan <subcommand>".

"CLAN APPLY"
 
Usage: clan apply <clan>
 
After gathering clan info and deciding a clan is right for you, you 
should apply to the clan. You can specify the clan by either its number 
or abbreviation as given in the clan list.
 
Examples:
    clan apply 3
    clan apply potc
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN LIST, CLAN INFO, CLAN ENROLL, CLAN REJECT
#0
"CLAN CREATE"
 
Usage: clan create <clan name>
 
This command is used to create a new clan. The specified clan name is used 
for both the new clan's name and abbreviation, so one should typically 
specify the new clan's abbreviation when creating the clan, then use the 
"clan set name" command to set the full name of the clan. You can specify 
non-alphabetic characters and color codes in the abbreviation, and they 
will be ignored when referring to the clan in other clan commands. For 
instance, naming a clan >>PotC<<, will allow you to later refer to it as 
simply potc.
 
Examples:
    clan create >>PotC<<
    clan set name potc Pirates of the Caribbean

#100
"CLAN DEMOTE"
 
Usage: clan demote <player>
 
This command allows a clan leader or privileged clan member to demote
subordinate clan members down through the clan ranks. The subordinate is 
only demoted one level at a time. You cannot demote someone at the same 
rank as you.
 
Examples:
    clan demote laochan
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN PROMOTE, CLAN PRIVILEGES
#0
"CLAN DEPOSIT"
 
Usage: clan deposit <amount>
 
This command allows clan members and alts to deposit currency into their
clan's general fund.
 
Examples:
    clan deposit 1000 platinum
    clan deposit 200 silver 500 copper
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN WITHDRAW, MONEY
#0
"CLAN DESTROY"
 
Usage: clan destroy <clan>
 
This command is used to destroy an existing clan. This action is not 
reversible from within the game. You can specify the clan either using its 
abbreviation or number as given by the "clan list" command.
 
When a clan is destroyed, all members, alts, and applicants are removed 
from the clan. The clan file is then backed up on the server.
 
Examples:
    clan destroy potc
    clan destroy 3
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN CREATE
#100
"CLAN ENROLL"
 
Usage: clan enroll <player>
 
This command allows clan leaders and privileged clan members to enroll 
applicants into their clan.
 
Examples:
    clan enroll laochan
    clan enroll noobie
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN APPLY, CLAN REJECT, CLAN PRIVILEGES
#0
"CLAN EXPEL"
 
Usage: clan expel <player>
 
This command allows clan leaders and privileged clan members to remove 
any undesirable or worthless members from the clan ranks. A clan member 
may only expel a clan member below their rank.
 
Examples:
    clan expel laochan
    clan expel noobie
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN QUIT, CLAN DEMOTE, CLAN PRIVILEGES
#0
"CLAN INFO"
 
Usage: clan info [<clan>]
 
This command displays information about a given clan. Either a clan 
number or abbreviation, as given by the "clan list" command, can be use 
to identify a clan. Anyone can use the "clan info" command to view 
public information about a clan, but only clan members and alts will be 
able to see the full information about their own clan. Clan members and 
alts may omit the clan to view information about their own clan.
 
Examples:
    clan info potc
    clan info
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN LIST, CLAN SET
#0
"CLAN LIST"
 
Usage: clan list
 
This command simply lists all clans in the realm. Some basic information 
about each clan is shown on the list. The "clan info" command can be used 
to determine more information about a clan.
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN INFO
#0
"CLAN PRIVILEGES"
 
Within a clan, some actions are considered "privileged" and can only be
performed by clan members with the requisite privilege. For instance,
demotions may only be performed by clan members with the 'demote' 
privilege. Each clan privilege can be set to a rank within a clan. If a 
member is at or above the rank defined for a privilege, he/she is 
considered to have that privilege. For instance, if the 'withdraw' 
privilege is set to rank 5, all members rank 5 and higher may withdraw
from the clan bank.
 
A clan privilege's rank may only be set by a clan leader, or equivalently 
a clan member at the highest rank in his/her clan, by the use of the
"clan set privilege" subcommand. See CLAN SET for more information.
 
Each clan privilege typically corresponds to a clan subcommand or set
ability. There are currently 11 defined clan privileges: demote, enroll,
expel, promote, setalt, setappfee, setapplev, setdesc, setdues, settitle,
and withdraw. Summaries of each privilege follow.
 
Privilege      Associated ability
-------------  ---------------------------------------------------------
demote         Demotion of members below the privileged member's rank
enroll         Admission of clan applicants
expel          Expulsion of members below the privileged member's rank
promote        Promotion of members below the privileged member's rank
setalt         Administration of clan member alts
setappfee      Changing a clan's application fee
setapplev      Changing a clan's minimum application level
setdesc        Modification of clan description
setdues        Changing a clan's monthly member dues
settitle       Modification of clan rank titless
withdraw       Withdrawal of money from clan bank

"CLAN PROMOTE"

Usage: clan promote <player>

This command allows a clan leader or privileged clan member to promote

subordinate clan members up through the clan ranks. The subordinate is 
only promoted one level at a time. You cannot promote someone at the
same rank as you.

Example:
    clan promote laochan

"CLAN QUIT"

Usage: clan quit

This command allows any clan member or alt to revoke their membership in 
a clan.
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN EXPEL
#0
"CLAN REJECT"
 
Usage: clan reject <player>
 
This command allows clan leaders and privileged clan members to reject
applicants into their clan. A clan member can use the "clan reject" 
subcommand if they have the enroll privilege.
 
Examples:
    clan reject laochan
    clan reject noobie
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN APPLY, CLAN ENROLL, CLAN PRIVILEGES
#0
"CLAN SNOOP"
 
Usage: clan snoop <clan>
       clan snoop all
       clan snoop off
 
The clan snoop command allows a deity to monitor the clan tell channel of 
one or all clans. When snooping a clan, a deity will see all 
communication on the clan's channel. A deity can also snoop all clans at 
once.

Snooping a clan changes the way the "clan tell" command behaves for that 
deity. When snooping a single clan, clan tell should be used without 
specifying a clan. When snooping all clans, the deity must specify to 
which clan they want to send the clan tell.
 
Examples:
    clan snoop potc
    clan tell hey potc'ers!

    clan snoop all
    clan tell potc heh heh
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN TELL
#100
"CLAN STATUS"
 
Usage: clan status
 
This command displays your status within your clan, telling you whether
you are an applicant, alt, or full member, and listing privileges and 
rank.
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN INFO
#0
"CLAN TELL" CTELL
 
Usage: clan tell [#<rank>] <message>
       ctell [#<rank>] <message>
 
Clan tell is a communication channel only available to members of a clan.
Members of one clan will not be able to see another clan's clan tell, 
only their own. The "ctell" command is just an alias for "clan tell", and 
can also be abbreviated as "ct". The optional rank parameter allows you
to limit who sees your clan communication to a given rank and higher. If
you are using standard ANSI color, clan tell shows up as bright purple.

Examples:
    ct Hey guys!
    clan tell #4 Haha, only rank 4 and above can see this!
    ct #5 Hey don't tell the newbies, but...

#0
"CLAN WHO"
 
Usage: clan who
 

Much like the normal "who" command, "clan who" displays all members of 
one's clan, listing those who are online. It also displays any applicants 
to a clan.
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, WHO, CLAN INFO
#0
"CLAN WITHDRAW"
 
Usage: clan withdraw <amount>
 
This command allows a privileged clan member to withdraw funds from their 
clan bank.
 
Examples:
    clan withdraw 100 silver
    clan withdraw 90 copper 50 gold

  type deal.. Guess I should hose with it some. Oh. This command has yet 
  to be implemented. Lovely. The plan of a clan should include all values
  and skills necessary for members.

CLASS SUB-CLASS CLASSES SUBCLASS SUB_CLASS
 
Fiery offers a wide range of character classes and abilities, all of 
which originate from four basic classes. Each of the basic classes have 
extraordinary growth potential throughout game play. As you begin your 
journey, you are limited to only these five classes. As you play and 
experience new areas and levels, you are faced with a decision to either 
specialize in a subclass, or retain your original class. If you choose to 
specialize, your abilities and powers will expand accordingly, leading 
the way to very powerful characters.
 
However, you may wish to remain a basic class. A basic class is not empty 
by far, and though it has no advantages that some of the subclasses 
offer, it also has no disabilities or drawbacks. Once you choose a 
subclass you cannot look back. You can not combine subclasses; you can 
only choose one. And when you do choose, your current skills/spells may 
change to reflect your choice. If you choose to become a cryomancer, you 
will cast down the spells of a basic sorcerer to embrace the art of 
cryomancy. These subclasses are obtained, if you so choose, by first 
becoming the proper level. All subclasses have a minimum level of 10. The 
actual choice will be made by finding the master of the subclass (see  
subclass_subclassname) to teach you. The master will ask you to prove 
your worthiness of the class by sending you on a quest. Actually finding 
the master may be a quest unto itself. Think hard on your choice.
 
Each class and subclass requires a different amount of experience to 
level. Not all characters will level at the same rate. Cleric and rogue 
types need an average amount of experience. Most warrior types need an 
above average amount of experience. Sorcerer types need a highly above 
average amount of experience. Monks and necromancers in particular need 
the highest amounts of experience, exceeding the requirements of the 
other classes due to their exceptional class abilities.

The maximum level to subclass is determined by your basic class. Warriors 
and rogues have until level 25, clerics have until level 35, and 
sorcerers have until level 45 to complete their subclass quests.
 
Important NOTE: not all races can be all classes! See the help on each 
class to determine specifics.
 
Warrior         Cleric          Sorcerer           Rogue

CLERIC
 
   Clerics are people of faith, believing in a higher source, and 
pondering the great questions of the universe. They pray to the powers 
that be to grant certain favors, and because of their faith are granted 
the desired results. Some clerics have been known to forget specializing 
and after learning all they can go on to learn an entirely different 
profession.
 
   Unlike sorcerers, clerics have access to all their known spells at all 
times without needing to scribe or carry them in a book. To cast a spell, 
a cleric must first REST, then MEDITATE and PRAY for a spell. The SPELL 
command will show all spells a cleric has access to. They can CAST the 
spell once it has been prayed for. They can CAST the spell once it has 
been memorized. After the spell has been cast, they will need to PRAY for 
it again. All cleric subclasses use the same pray-cast-pray flow of play.
 
Primary Attributes:   Intelligence, Wisdom 
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all), Duergar, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-Elf,

COMPOSITION

The physical composition of a creature is predictive of its reaction to 
various kinds of attacks. Most creatures are composed of flesh, for it 
is highly responsive to the force of life. However, it is also widely 
vulnerable.

Elemental creatures tend to be resistant or immune to attacks that mimic 
their own compositions. Fire elementals take no damage whatsoever from 
fire attacks, while fogs and mists react only a little to air magic. On 
the other hand, they are often uniquely vulnerable to an opposing 
element.

Beings not composed of flesh are generally immune to poison and have a 
wide range of other resistances. However, they usually (but not always!) 
have some vulnerability that the attentive adventurer can capitalize.

There are even beings with no physical form whatsoever. Some elemental 
magics can harm them, but in general they laugh at the attacks of mere 
mortals. It is said, however, that a simple cleric's blessing (or the 
diabolist's spell of "dark presence") can empower fighters to destroy 
these spectres.

The identify spell will reveal a character's composition.

The following table lists the vulnerabilities of each type of physical 
composition to the physical damage types.

Type of spell : Sphere of Divination
Classes       : Cryomancer, Diabolist, Ranger, Sorcerer,
              : Necromancer, Pyromancer
======================================================
 
Of all the races in the realm each has a language to master. It is up to 
a player to associate himself with other races, including creatures of  
other races, in an attempt to become more familiar with the languages. To 
aid in easing the pain of complete mastery, the casters of the realm have 
figured ways to understand each other through magic!

================================================
Usage   : conceal <object>
Classes : Rogue        Level 25
        : Thief        Level 10
================================================

Miscreants are often quite good at hiding objects they don't wish to 
carry - or dare not be caught with. Items of reasonable size can be 
swiftly hidden from view, though a casual SEARCH may easily uncover it 
again.

wisely in battle. Such a foe can only be less dangerous, because there is 
the chance it will attack someone other than the caster's ally by 
mistake.

CONJURER

This class is unavailable pending completion.

   Conjurers are mages that have concentrated on the essence of creation. 
These mages can take raw ethereal power and transform it into material
substances. Conjurers have even been known to infuse material items and
beings with magical power and enchantments. Unlike Illusionists, 
conjurers practice true creation instead of perceived creation, which 
gives them higher stability, but a limited range of effects. Some of the 
greatest monsters and magical items written of in all the lore of the 
world were created by conjurers. 

Primary Attributes:   Intelligence
Allowed Races:        Human, Gnome, Orc, Half-Elf, Halfling

     *Note:  Conjurers are a subclass of Sorcerer and, as with all other
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

CONSENT

Usage:    consent <player>    - give your consent to <player>
          consent off         - revoke your consent
          consent             - get a reminder of who you're consenting

This command will allow the object of CONSENT to perform certain trusted 
actions, including:

* induct you into a group
* remove items from your corpse (should you die)
* drag your corpse around

You may only CONSENT to one person at a time.

CONSIDER

Usage: consider <victim>

CONSIDER is used to compare your group's strength in battle versus that 
of a potential foe. You will receive a message indicating a rough 
estimate, which is by no means exact, of your group's chances. CONSIDER 
does not take hitpoints/special attacks/damage into account. Nor does it 
evaluate racial differences currently - understand a mid-level dragon 
will be a bit more difficult than a mid-level guard.

Example:

  > consider guard
Now where did that chicken go?

This message is for a group. So if you are a magic user don't think you 
can solo this guy.

CONSTITUTION

Constitution is a measure of your physical fortitude and endurance.
It has a marked effect on your hit points--for high Constitution values, 
your hit points rise by a multiple of your level. Constitution also 
determines how many movement points you start off with.

Your paralyze save is helped by your Constitution. Dwarves, duergar, 
gnomes, dragonborn, sverfneblins, and halflings also get bonuses to their 
Spell, Paralyze, and Wand saves depending on their Constitution.

CRYOMANCER
 
   Cryomancers are mages that have melded the essence of water with their 
own powers, giving them incredible influence over the primal element of 
water. The element of water is mainly associated with emotions and 
transformation. These mages use water in its frozen aspect to shred any 
who oppose them. From turning the ground beneath their foes to ice, mud, 
or even a flood up to encasing them in solid ice, a cryomancer is surely 
not one to mess with. Cryomancers have been seen walking upon the surface 
of water as well as walking beneath it with no want of air. They are seen 
as ambassadors to the material plane from the plane of water, and have no 
problems with any other elementalists, but harbor no love for fire 
elementalists. 
 
Primary Attributes:   Intelligence
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all except Fire), Gnome, Half-Elf, 
                      Halfling, Human, Orc, Sverfneblin
 
Experience to Level:  Highly Above Average
 
     *Note:  Cryomancers are a subclass of sorcerer and, as with all 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

to give striking power and magical resistance to his allies. Those who 
are evil who maintain DARK PRESENCE will hit harder and be seen as more 
evil than before. This spell will be ineffective on those who are
neutral or good.

Usage: dc <descriptor number>|<player name>

DC (DisConnect) is used to disconnect a socket. If used on a playing 
socket, the player will lose his/her link, but, unlike PURGE, will not
extract the player or dump the player's inventory on the ground. 

DC is also useful for disconnecting people who have accidentally left
themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name"
state.

DEATH DIEING DYING

Well, if your hit points make it to -10 you DIE like the dogs you are. 
What does this mean to you?  You will lose approximately 20 percent of 
the exp you needed to get to what would have been your next level at time 
of death. If you die and lose enough exp you can lose your current level 
and access to any spells or skills gained at that level. Losing level is 
bad news. 

A corpse is generated of your former self when you fall to the ground 
dead. This corpse will be located where you died and will contain all the 
possessions you had on your body at time of death. To get your 
possessions back you will need to go to your corpse and loot it. When you 
die you will reenter the game at your point of sanctuary, whatever that 
point that is, and be severely wounded.

===============================================
 
This spell forces a large amount of harmful energy into the victim's 
flesh--for the living, this can cause extensive muscular deterioration 
even to the point of death, but such negative energy seems to have an 
inverse strengthening effect on the undead. This is a quest spell.

To find this in-game quest: 
Strange creatures are assisting the forces of the undead. A determined 
necromancer may be able to learn some secrets about bolstering their 
risen forces.

DEITY RELIGION

THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!

Each character on Fiery must select a deity at creation. Some characters
will go on to be some type of religious class, such as cleric or shaman. 
These classes rely on their deity to grow in power, and to gain new 
spells and skills. The different deities represented on Fiery control 
various spheres of influence, such as a particular race, or type of magic. 
Each has unique power, and bestows benefits upon followers as they 
increase in level. This increase in level is a reflection that the 
character is growing closer to the deity in the religious relationship. 
 
Each deity has a specific alignment range that followers must adhere to. 
In the case of alignment deviation, punishment is swift, and in most
cases, quite harsh. As religious characters grow in level, the chances of
divine intervention on their behalf is greatly increased. Divine
intervention can be something as simple as smiting an opponent in battle,
or allowing your spells to be cast instantaneously during a combat, or
something as dramatic as an avatar joining your group to kill a religious
opponent. 

Currently all a character has to do in order to 'worship' a deity is
choose at character creation, and then maintain the appropriate alignment
throughout their adventures on Fiery. As levels increase, benefits and
punishments are much more meaningful to the game world as a whole.

DELETED DELETION IDLE

Currently players can not delete themselves. There is no ETA on when this
functionality will return.

In the past, characters with long stretches of inactivity were marked for 
deletion to make space in the game system. Since storage capacity and 
connection speed now vastly exceed anything we could ever possibly use, 
characters are no longer deleted due to inactivity.

Previously players were allowed 4 weeks, plus three days per level before 
they were marked for deletion.

DEXTERITY SYLL
 
Dexterity is a measure of your agility and flexibility, and is actually 
one of the most flexible and versatile attributes, showing up in many 
places. It plays into success rates for numerous skills, including 
CONCEAL, SNEAK, INSTANT KILL, DISARM, CORNER, HIDE, and STEAL. It also 
helps determine how much LAYHANDS heals or damages.
 
Of course, Dexterity plays an integral role in combat. High Dexterity 
values also help lower your AC. Perhaps most importantly, Dexterity plays 
directly into the hit-miss calculations, helping you DODGE, PARRY, and 
RIPOSTE your enemy's attacks. Your Dexterity attribute helps you stay 
standing when someone casts EARTHQUAKE, too.
 
Dexterity plays a small part in determining your Wand and Breath saves. 
It also determines how many items you can carry at your level.

DIABOLIST
 
   Diabolists are clerics that have followed the dark paths to the heart 
of chaos. Their allegiance with the great powers of evil gives them 
powers to summon demons and cause other great effects of chaos and 
destruction. It has been said that the greatest diabolists resemble the 
demons they have charge over. It is also said to never trust the word of 
a diabolist, for they see life itself as a disease to be cut from the 
very fabric of existence and will always turn on you. Diabolists seek 
only to plunge the world into chaos, and undo the creation of all good 
things.
 
Primary Attributes:   Wisdom, Intelligence
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all), Duergar, Human, Orc, Sverfneblin
 
Experience to Level:  Average

     *Note:  Diabolists are a subclass of cleric and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

DRAGONBORN "RACE DRAGONBORN"

As their name implies, dragonborn are cousins of the mighty true dragons. 
Of mixed dragon and humanoid heritage, dragonborn are bipedal and lack 
wings. Like their winged brethren, dragonborn can be found the world 
over, living in nearly any climate or environment as suits their liking. 
Dragonborn lack the mystical connection to a hoard true dragons enjoy, 
but their inherently magical nature often leads them to esoteric 
pursuits. They stand taller and heavier than the average human of their 
gender.

Dragonborn are broken down into five varieties based on their breath 
weapons, vestiges of their draconic ancestry. Their body is covered in 
small scales, colored to reflect their heritage as well: red or gold for 
fire dragonborn, white or silver for frost dragonborn, blue or bronze for 
lightning dragonborn, black or brass for acid dragonborn, and green or 
copper for gas dragonborn. Unlike true dragons however, dragonborn do not 
have any particular alignment based on their color; a dragonborn is free 
to choose their own path regardless of their ancestry.

"DRAGONS HEALTH" DH

===============================================
Usage         : cast 'dragons health' [<target>]
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : support
Area of effect: target
Accumulative  : refresh
Duration      : 1 - 10 hours
Sphere        : enchantment
Fade message  : Your health returns to normal.
Classes       : Cleric         Circle 12 (quest)
              : Priest         Circle 12 (quest)
===============================================
 
Similar to the weaker VITALITY and ENDURANCE spells, DRAGONS HEALTH 
allows a cleric to invoke significantly more health into a creature with 
just a touch. This vitalization increases the victim hit points 
temporarily, in an amount dependent on the cleric's proficiency. When 
this spell wears off, the victim's hit points will drop by the amount 
they were increased, and if one's hit points are negative, it is possible 
to die. This spell does not combine with other vitality-type spells.

This is a quest spell. Ancient songs echo through the memories of 
dragons. Some are capable of conferring incredible magic that can bolster 
mortal vitality beyond compare. A chance to learn one such power has 
popped up with a dragonborn caretaker on distant shores.

DRUID
 
   Druids are clerics that have taken to the forces of nature as their 
source of power. Nature has an incredible influence over all things in 
the world, and Druids are able to utilize that influence. Druids tend not 
to tangle in the ways of good or evil, but live solitary lives in their 
forest homes. Druids often cooperate with rangers to the ends of 
preserving nature, but do not follow them on their biased path. Druids 
are benevolent, and seek to aid all living things, and will leave well 
enough alone as long as their forests aren't harmed. However, harming the 
realm of a Druid can cause the realm itself to rise up against you and 
will surely be your demise. 
 
Primary Attributes:   Wisdom, Charisma, Intelligence
Allowed Races:        Gnome, Half-Elf, Human
 
Experience to Level:  Average
 
     *Note:  Druids are a subclass of cleric and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

        : Thief          Level 15
        : Warrior        Level 25
================================================
 
DUAL WIELD is a skill that allows you to wield two weapons at once, one 
in each hand. Your ability to wield a second weapon is dependent on the 
weight of the second weapon and your proficiency at DUAL WIELD. The 
higher your DUAL WIELD proficiency, the more often you will hit with both 
weapons in a combat round.
 
DUAL WIELD is also required for assassins' double BACKSTAB. It is not 
possible to BACKSTAB with two weapons unless you are able to wield two 
weapons. DUAL WIELD does not apply to combat without weapons, including 
monks' BAREHAND skill.

DWARF DWARVES "MOUNTAIN DWARF"
 
The most noble race of demihumans, they dwell deep inside the earth, 
forging great cities and waging massive wars against the forces of chaos 
and evil. Dwarves have much in common with the rock and gems they love 
to work - both hard and unyielding, they are renown for their sturdy 
Constitution and bullish stubbornness as much as their long beards and 
mustaches. Commonly stocky and muscular, they range from about four to 
four-and-a-half feet in size. Their skin is typically tan to a light 
brown with ruddy cheeks, and bright eyes. A dwarf's mortal enemy is a 
dark dwarf, or duergar.

were granted when the spell wears off may actually die.

GREATER ENDURANCE, VITALITY, and GREATER VITALITY. Not all classes get 
all of these, and rumors speak of an even stronger spell in existence.

ENFORCEMENT PUNISHMENT JUSTICE

First, in every incident the deity addressing the problem MUST get both 
sides of the story. Talk to the primary people involved, then talk to 
other people removed from the situation if you are still uncertain. Use 
your knowledge of each of the players (ie: a known liar, or someone with 
an extensively negative 'notes' file would be taken less at his/her word 
than someone with a clean record).

Also, make a note on the player in question. We implemented this 
functionality for a reason. "Player did this, I followed these steps, he 
was warned as a XX offense, and punished by YY." as per the stages of 
punishment outlined below.


1st offense) Talk to the player, 1-on-1, tell them what rule they
   broke, reason to them that no fancy talk on their part changes 
   that fact, and make it clear that this is their only reprocution-
   less warning and next time has consequences. Make a NOTE about 
   the discussion, and known alternate/primary characters on the PC.

2nd offense) Take the player in question aside and inform them they
   had been warned. They are now subject to punishment. The uniform
   punishment for this stage is that the offending character is to
   be frozen for 1 days time. Exceptions to this would be for an
   inappropriate use of a communication channel, in which 'mute'
   would be used as an appropriate substitution for freeze. Make
   a NOTE on the player.

3rd offense) Tell the player this is their final warning punishment.
   The offending character is to lose 1/2 of their levels, rounded
   down. If you do not have the authority to re-level a character,
   make a note on the 'justice' thread on the forums and someone
   else will take action as soon as possible. Freeze the character
   until such time as 1/2 their levels are taken. The deity who
   enacts the 1/2 leveling should make a note on the 'justice' thread 
   saying the punishment has been enforced. Make sure the player
   realizes that this is their LAST chance to shape up and tell
   them what awaits them upon a 4th offense.

4th offense) This is the final offense. We no longer consider this
   person a viable addition to the playerbase and they are to be
   removed. Each of his/her known characters is to be frozen, set
   to level 1, and placed in the 'icebox' (room 1202). His/her
   current IP address is to be banned. Please note this last
   action in the 'justice' thread on the forums.

These rules are in an attempt to unify punishment and decisions made 
among the deity staff of FieryMUD. Please suggest modifications and 
additions to these rules.

EXCHANGE MONEY CURRENCY
 
Different vendors, banks and merchants about the realms will EXCHANGE 
higher level coins for lower level ones and vice versa. This will happen 
more often for a profit for the exchanger than not. The raw EXCHANGE 
values are:

     1 Platinum coin = 10 gold coins
     1 Gold coin     = 10 silver coins
     1 Silver coin   = 10 copper coins

So, 1000 copper = 100 silver = 10 gold = 1 platinum.

EXPANDMOBS
 
Usage: toggle expandmobs

For instance, with EXPANDMOBS TOGGLED on, 3 guards and a blob might 
appear as:
 
    A peasant guard stands here.
    A peasant guard stands here.
    An oozing green gelatinous blob is here, sucking in bits of debris.
    A peasant guard stands here.
 
but with EXPANDMOBS TOGGLED off, it would display:

EXPERIENCE XP
 
Usage: experience
 
At any time when you're not fighting, you can type experience or level to
get a statement of how close you are to leveling.
 
Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points. When 
enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.
 
Note: Different classes require different amounts of experience to level.
 
When you are ready to level, you must return to your guildmaster and use 
the "LEVEL GAIN" command.
 
Things you should know about experience points:
 
  * When damaging a monster, you get experience points.
 
  * If you kill a monster of higher level than yourself, you get 
    bonus experience points. If killing a monster of lower level 
    you'll gain fewer experience points.
 
  * If you keep killing the same monster over and over, your 
    experience will decrease. See TROPHY.
 
  * Completing certain in-game quests will also reward you with 
    experience.
 
  * When you are grouped, you share exp from monster kills with 
    your entire group.

"EYE GOUGE" EYEGOUGE GOUGE

=========================================
Usage      : gouge <target>
Aggressive : yes
Classes    : Rogue          Level 10
=========================================

A somewhat "dirty" tactic, gouging an opponent's eyes out promises
blindness and the inability to see for an indefinite period of time. In 
gouging out eyes, rogues use their bare hands, jamming their thumbs 
forcefully into enemies' eye sockets. This is no attack for the weak of 
heart. Gouging eyes out also causes a small amount of damage, dependent 
on the rogue's level.

Victims of EYE GOUGE may have their vision restored by any of the normal 
methods.

enter a state of catatonia.

FINISHED COMPLETE
The following areas are supposedly complete, and should be running on the 
game:

Update (02/16/01):
Tanle has gone through the whole help file and adjusted incorrectly 
spelled words. New zones and expanded old zones coming soon. Fiery 
Island, Griffin Isle, and Nordus quests should be finished. Previously 
all the subclass quests were written and implemented.

Update (11/18/00):
A whole year later, Tanle finds this file. Help areas is current, so I
would suggest checking that file for all the zones, as much has happened.

Update (12/20/99):
Azkrael just found this help file. Next file swap, Nordus, Fiery Island,  
Kings of Dreams, and Griffin Isle will be added. Anduin is completed 
after about ten years of being in beta state and was added a month ago. 
Now that we're sure nobody will be assassinated by their own guildmaster, 
we'll be moving bad guys up there.

Update (4/19/99):
Graveyard is now implemented.
Rockwell should have been included on the first edit.

Update (4/22/99):
Dancing Dolphin Inn and Beachhead are now done....good luck getting to 
them.

in order to cause extra damage. FIRE DARTS will sling forth and burn an 
enemy in much the same way common missile attacks cause concussion 
damage. As pyromancers advance in circles they continue mastery and are 
able to sling more than one dart at a time. Six is the maximum number of 
darts.

dedicated enough to tread in their wake.

FORGET

Usage: forget <spell>
       forget all

FORGET is used by a caster to "erase" the spell name from their 
memorization queue. If the spell name given is not listed in the caster's 
queue, then it is removed from the MEMORIZED list. Only one occurence of 
the spell name will be removed at a time. Once a spell is forgotten, 
another spell may be added. (Only a spell of the same circle may replace 
the spell forgotten.)
 
Example:

    If Harnak wanted to forget magic missile, he would type:
    >forget magic

    If he wanted to forget EVERYTHING he's memorized, he'd type:
    >forget all

magic user. The mind numbing cold circles all in the area causing great 
damage to those who can suffer from cold or fail to save. This is the area

       get | take all [container]
       get | take all all.<container>
       get | take all.<object> all.<container>

Fade message  : Your visage becomes plain once again.
Classes       : none
============================================================

GLORY gives the caster the appearance of a glorious being in the eyes of 
those who behold him or her. Attention is drawn to the caster like a moth 
to the flame and aggressive creatures are mesmerized and forget to 
attack.

The downside is that there is a small chance that such creatures will 
still attack, and if they do, their target is sure to be the caster.

GNOMES
 
Cousin to the dwarves, they resemble them as small, thin, and nimble kin. 
Noticeably though, Gnomes tend to keep their beards shorter and stylishly 
trimmed and they take pride in their enormous noses (often twice the size 
of any normal human or dwarf). Their skin is usually a dark tan to woody 
brown, often with hints of gray, startling to pale-blue eyes and 
sandy-pale hair. Millennia of underground dwelling have given them 
excellent vision in the dark and their keen intellect make them a cunning 
adversary. They are distant cousins of sverfneblins, the deep gnomes who 
dwell in the Underdark.

GOSSIP NOGOSSIP
 
Most global channels on Fiery have been removed. However gossip has made 
a return as a global channel. Game information is allowed, but we prefer 
to only give hints about exploration and game world information. In 
particular we ask that you do not share quest details over gossip.
 
Something that is NOT allowed on gossip is swearing. Please keep it clean 
- this is a mutable (permanently removing your ability to communicate) 
offense.
 
Direct any questions for gods to petition. Questions for other players 
should mostly be restricted to tells or shouts.

GOTO TRANSFER WIZTELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       transfer <victim>
       teleport <victim> <location>

These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different 
rooms. GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANSFER transports a person 
from wherever they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your 
victim to some other location.

For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specified can be either a 
virtual room number, or the name of a character or object.

Examples:

  > goto 3001
  > goto rasmussen
  > transfer fido

"GROUND SHAKER"
 
================================================
Usage      : stomp
Aggressive : yes
Classes    : Berserker      Level 75
================================================
 
Initiated with the STOMP command, GROUND SHAKER is a powerful outlet for 
rage that rends the very ground beneath the berserker (and his 
opponents). It causes victims to either fall to their knees or take 
damage from the tumultuous earth tremors. If victims fall to their knees, 
it causes them to stop casting, similar to BASH, but does no damage. 
GROUND SHAKER can only be used outdoors and while in a BERSERK trance and 
under the influence of SPIRIT OF THE BEAR.

GROUP

Usage : group <player>
      : group all

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be
shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of
the killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have
been participating in the fight.

To form a group certain steps must be accomplished:
First, a group leader must be chosen.

Once this is accomplished, each person who wishes to be included into the
group must type CONSENT <leader>.

Then, it is up to the leader to type GROUP <player>, in order to include
that player into the group. The leader can type GROUP ALL to group all 
players currently consenting them.

NPCs who have been charmed, such as an illusionist's illusions or a 
necromancer's animated corpses, can be grouped as well if they have been 
ORDERED to CONSENT the group leader. The group leader must GROUP those 
pets BY NAME INDIVIDUALLY - they will not be grouped by typing GROUP ALL.

If the leader wishes to remove a certain member from the group for

and movement points, type GROUP with no arguments.

============================================================
*This is a in-game quest spell*

With sufficient skill in healing, it becomes second nature to a cleric,
giving the ability to heal multiple targets simultaneously. This talent 
is manifested in the group heal spell. It heals all members of the 
caster's group who are in the same room as the cleric, and can only be 
cast when in a group. The restorative power of this spell is equivalent 
to HEAL.
 
The doctor is in! One of the chief medical missionaries near Mielikki has

infallible. This skill may also work for some aggressive spells.

GUILD

A class guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the 
troubles and perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded, so 
that only members may enter the building. Guilds are also the places where 
people come to learn and practice the skills of their trade. Note that the 
Rogue's Guild of Mielikki is hidden somewhere in town. Think of tracking 
it down as your first challenge as a person of the shadows!

A class's guildhouse like this is ENTIRELY DIFFERENT from those used by 
formal player guilds/clans (see: GUILDS or CLANS). All classes get their 
own sort of guildhouse where they can practice skills. A formal player's 
guild hall is a members-only club that can (but doesn't always) allow all 
sorts of people into it as long as they have a key. Clear as mud?

GUILDS CLANS

Player guilds or clans are groupings of like-minded people who have 
written a formal declaration of intent to the mud's administration which 
has been accepted for use. Guilds get some very important bonuses: They 
get their own global communication channel (see CTELL), their own guild 
house (see GUILD), and occasionally even their own shops and gear. This 
comes at a price: Guilds are expensive to start and maintain, and every 
one of these perks are ungodly expensive too.

Probably the hardest aspect of being a guild is that gods consider guilds
free game for bothering with roleplay and quests.

HALF-ELF HALF-ELVES HALF_ELF
 
Being of human stock, half-elves have features and benefits of both their 
human and elven parents. Their height usually ranges higher and their 
weight heavier than common elves, growing as tall as 5 feet and weighing

Prejudice plays an influential role to half-elves, as they are often seen 
as "half-breeds" and outcasts from elven society. Needing to navigate 
multiple cultures, they have developed stronger social graces and a knack 
for pleasantries.

casting heaven's gate at another player somewhere else in the game.

use of the tunnels--those with evil in their hearts will find a nasty 
surprise waiting for within. HEAVENS GATE is a quest spell.
 
In a hidden chamber deep below ground, the light of the stars reveal the 
secret to unlocking HEAVENS GATE. Daring priests now have a chance to 
commune with voices from beyond and learn this secret for themselves.

open up dark passages through the earth, linking two locations by casting 
hell gate at another player somewhere else in the game. Entering the

passages--those with truth in their hearts will find the journey through 
the portal too disturbing for their own sanity. 

HELL GATE is a quest spell. Demonic voices whisper from the depths of 
Garl'lixxil. Those most dedicated to their service may find secrets of 
hell-bound travel if they seek out the place that fiendish domain comes

           : Thief        Level 1
================================================

The HIDE skill gives your character Hiddenness points depending on your
proficiency. When hidden, you may only be seen by other characters whose 
Perception stat is greater than or equal to your Hiddenness. However, 
HIDE is broken by most commands. When hidden, others may reveal your 
location by searching in the same room, which causes you to become 
visible.

When moving while hidden, those who can see you will see SNEAKING.
Movement while hidden will cause you to lose Hiddenness points; the 
amount is dependent on your skill in SNEAK.

============================================================

Those who fight for the side of light can eventually be granted a very 
powerful holy power to speak a single word that evil beings take such 
offense to that it will actually cause them significant damage. Those evil 
beings who react to this righteous word in a particularly poor manner have 
a chance to actually go blind or become paralyzed. This spell resembles 
DISPEL EVIL with an area effect nature.

#100
HOTBOOT

Usage: hotboot [yes | force]

Hotbooting is an alternative to a 'cold' reboot. In a hotboot, players
are not disconnected, the game is rebooted, and the player connections
are passed on to the rebooted game. This is typically more convenient
for players, as they will not have to re-login. However, they will be
returned to the last place they rented or camped, as if they had
logged off and logged back on.

Hotbooting reloads all world and text files, and restarts the game
executable so code changes take effect also. The boot time from the
previous 'cold' reboot is preserved.

When attempting to hotboot, you will be warned and no hotboot will occur
if anyone is attempting to log in, creating a new character, or editing
in OLC. You may override this check with 'hotboot force', however.
In the hotboot is forced, anyone attempting to log in or create a new
character will be automatically disconnected.

HUMAN HUMANS
 
Ne'er seen one before eh? Try using a mirror ya bloody oaf! The most 
predominant race by far, they are crafty and cunning, as they are greedy 
and unwittingly bent on self destruction. Many of the more "older" or 
longer living races often view them as foolish children, with their petty 
squabbles. Humans have no inherent alignment orientation but are 
classified as a good race.
  
They hold better overall ability scores than other races, making them a 
jack of all trades. Well rounded for any class or occupation, humans can 
be found throughout the known world as merchants, traders, soldiers, 
pilgrims and oftentimes in tribal cultures, as well as holding various 
social rank in larger cities. They fill a very similar niche as Orcs do 
for the evil races.

HUNTER

NOTE THIS CLASS HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE GAME

   Stalking their prey and closing in for the kill, hunters are in it 
purely for the sport. They have a sense of mastery over all forms of 
life, seeing everything as a prey animal, and themselves as the predator. 
Hunters have many of the same skills as rangers, but are shunned by 
nature as wasteful killers. Rangers and druids harbor a particular hate 
toward Hunters. Poaching in the wild lands is a favorite pastime for 
hunters, and druids and rrangers will stop at nothing to eradicate any 
hunter within their realm. Hunters, on the other hand, see rangers and 
druids as excellent prey, and choose to stalk them over any other animals 
they may find.

Primary Attributes:   Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence
Allowed Races:        Troll, Duergar, Orc

     *Note:  Hunters are a subclass of rogue and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

============================================================

protect them on the field of battle. Casting this spell surrounds them in 
a hard casing of ice, which aids in protecting them from physical harm. 
It will also add a COLDSHIELD effect. It does not combine with other 
armor-type spells.

Sorcerers who have a mastery of ice can frost their missile attacks in 
order to cause extra damage. ICE DARTS will sling forth and chill an 
enemy in much the same way common missile attacks cause concussion 
damage. As cryomancers advance in circles they continue mastery and are 
able to sling more than one dart at a time. Six is the maximum number of 
darts.

Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : water
Classes       : Cryomancer     Circle 12 (quest)
============================================================
 
One of the greatest weapons in a cryomancer's arsenal, this spell summons
a virtual blizzard of razor sharp shards of ice that tear mercilessly
through all whom the caster would wish harm upon. ICE SHARDS is a quest
spell.
 
The most powerful of the cryomancer spells has been lost for centuries. 
However, some from long-descended sorcerous bloodlines still remember 
a thing or two about the past. Perhaps you can help them piece together 
the puzzle and discover devastating new powers.

Aggressive    : yes
Effect        : direct attack

freeze the water in the air around the caster, growing exponentially as 
it moves away from the point of origin until it slams into the face of 
the enemy, dealing a fair amount of damage.

IDENTIFY
 
Identification of objects can be performed by simple examination or by 
the casting of a spell. Thieves are quite adept at this, and will have 
little need for magic. The use of the command is:
 
  identify <target>
 
The spell is used as follows:
 
============================================================
Usage         : cast 'identify' [<target | object>]
Min. position : sitting
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : support
Area of effect: target
Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : divination
Classes       : Necromancer    Circle 5
              : Sorcerer       Circle 3
============================================================
 
This spell is extremely useful, as it will reveal much - though not all! 
- about an item. Though few classes actually get this spell, Bigby sells 
scrolls of identify for a very reasonable cost. This spell can be cast at 
an item you are wearing, in your inventory, or on the ground.
 
Casting this spell at a player or mob will give you some interesting, 
though essentially useless, information.

IEDIT
 
Usage: iedit <object>
 
The item editor allows gods to modify existing prototyped items and make 
them unique using the oedit OLC editor. You use iedit on an actual live 
instance of an object, not the vnum-indexed prototype. In other words, if 
you are holding an item, you can iedit it. You can edit items in your 
equipment, in your inventory, or in the room, and it looks for items in 
that order.
 
When you successfully iedit an object, its vnum is set to -1.
 
See also: OEDIT
#101
IGNORE

Usage: ignore <player>

The IGNORE command allows you to block incoming tells from a single 
player. If someone is spamming you or misbehaving, just IGNORE them. 
Typing IGNORE without an argument will make you stop ignoring someone.

originally did. It will also dispel the effects of the DARKNESS spell.

ILLUSIONIST

   Illusionists are mages that have concentrated on the ability to alter 
perception, and fool the weak of mind. They understand all too well that 
seeing is believing, and can create an incredible array of effects 
ranging through all the five senses. Illusionists have been known to raze 
entire cities to the ground, and leave the illusion of ruins, only to 
have the city evacuated and overtaken without a single bit of damage. The 
influence these mages have over the weak minded often makes them seem as 
gods, but only to those that don't understand their power.
 
Primary Attributes:   Intelligence
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all), Gnome, Half-Elf, Halfling, Human, 
                      Orc, Sverfneblin
 
Experience to Level:  Highly Above Average
 
     *Note:  Illusionists are a subclass of sorcerer and, as with all 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

IMMORTALS IMMORTALITY 100

Immortals are people who have reached level 100. They should be respected
for having met and overcome the challenges of FieryMUD.
 
However, there are certain rules they must abide by:
 
0. They must not interfere with or hinder mortals.
1. That means no STAT'ing players or objects for mortals.
2. NO killing for mortals. Immortals cannot give away objects or 
   equipment.
3. NO reimbursement for death traps or death.
4. NO experience reimbursement.
 
Nobody likes rules, but we need them to keep the game fun and 
interesting. The purpose of mudding is to overcome the challenge. We 
wouldn't dare deprive you of that by assisting you in any way that would 
cause you to avoid such challenges inherent in the game.

#0
INNATE
 
Usage: innate
       innate <effect>
 
INNATE effects are special skills and spells. The INNATE command lists 
the innate skills and effects available to you based on your race. 
Effects on this list marked with a * symbol are always in effect. Effects 
on the list without a * must be activated to take effect. Most are 
activated by typing INNATE <effect>, where effect is the name of the 
innate effect. Otherse, such as BREATHE, BODYSLAM, CREATE, DOORBASH, and 
SPRINGLEAP, are activated with their own commands. Activated abilities 
are limited in duration and typically have a cooldown before they can be 
used again. Using the same INNATE twice will not increase its effect.
 
There are a large variety of innates. For instance, half-elves have  
INFRAVISION always present, so they can see in the dark all the time. 
Dwarves have access to an innate reserve of Wisdom through their TASS 
ability, but it is not always present, so to invoke it they would need to 
type INNATE TASS. Dragonborn have special breath weapons determined by 
their race, activated with BREATHE <energy>. Much like magic spells, most 
innate effects that are not always present cannot be invoked in rooms 
where magic is suppressed.

"INSTANT KILL"
 
================================================
Usage      : Involuntary
Aggressive : N/A
Classes    : Assassin       Level 1
================================================
 
This is an involuntary assassin skill. When assassins become more skilled 
and powerful, they slowly increase their vile abilities. There exists a 
chance while fighting with an assassin that they will almost innately 
find your weak spot and seize the opportunity to kill you instantly. Be 
warned.
 
At this time, this skill is not only involuntary but buggy. You can't 
TELL the game to instant-kill somebody. It just happens. Moreover, 
sometimes odd things happen with it. Please report when odd things 
happen. (see BUG)

INTELLIGENCE BRILL
 
Intelligence is a measure of your mind's quickness. Along with Wisdom, it 
determines whether your proficiency in a skill increases when you use 
that skill. Your Intelligence plays into some skill and spell success 
rates, such as conceal, spell knowledge, and animate dead. It also 
determines how long CHARM PERSON lasts.

IPTABLES

Usage: iptables list
       iptables add <ip address>|<player>
       iptables delete <line number>

This allows coders to give themselves access to Fiery's development
server. The firewall normally prevents most incoming connections, but
coders need to connect via SSH and HTTP.

Use 'iptables add <name>' to add the ip address of a particular player. 
IP addresses can also be specified explicitly. Use 'iptables delete <#>'
to remove addresses, by the line number from 'iptables list'.

JUNK

Usage: junk <item>
       junk all.<item>
       junk <number> <coins>

If you really lose interest in a carried item, you can throw it away, 
causing it to cease to exist. There is no way to recover a junked item, 
so use this command wisely.

However, junking coins actually just drops them.

KICK
 
================================================
Usage      : kick <victim>

           : Warrior        Level 1
================================================
 
The success of a KICK depends upon your skill proficiency. The higher 
level you reach, the more damage you do when you KICK successfully. There 
is one small catch -- whenever you KICK (or miss) you will be unable to 
type any command for a short period of time.

LAG LINKDEATH CRASH CRASHES RESET RESETS REIMBURSEMENT

&6&bThese policies are obsolete&0
 
This information will try and provide you with information about 
FieryMUD's policies on LinkDeath, Lag, Crashes and Resets.

LAG - LAG is an extended period of time when "nothing happens" on the MUD. 
Lag is 99.9% of the time caused by YOUR Internet Provider. FieryMUD is 
running on a nice fast new machine with an Internet connection with tons 
of bandwidth. We do not reimburse if you LinkDie because of severe lag 
caused by anything other than FieryMUD's own resources.

LinkDeath - Occurs when a player is inactive for a long period of time.
If you LinkDie, you will drop all of your equipment and coins where
you were standing. When you re-enter the game you will be at
The Forest Temple of Mielikki. You will generally not be reimbursed for
LinkDeath unless it is deemed FieryMUD's fault, even then it is up to the
discretion of the FieryMUD Gods.
 
Crashes - Crashes happen for various reasons and cannot be controlled.
You may think that since crashes are caused by FieryMUD that you can
get a reimbursement. If there is a crash and you lose something
(You DID remember to SAVE right?) it is up to the discretion of the gods
whether a reimbursement is possible in your case.

Resets - Resets happen on purpose. There are an EXTREMELY few occurrences
of resets. If they happen you will be given time to RENT. If not
you will most likely be forced to rent by a God anyway. If by chance
a reset occurs and you do lose something, talk to a God a reimbursement
may be in order.

LAWS RULES SLAYER 

Note this statement. It is an overriding statement of policy about 
Fiery's Laws and Rules. Just because you can do something that will let 
you get around the spirit of the rules does NOT make it a legal action! 
Breaking the rules in spirit is the same as breaking the rules period 
and both will be treated the same. 

Fiery's Laws 

     I. No player killing or player stealing is allowed at this time, 
        except during special predefined "pk / psteal" periods. 
        Level 20 and below characters are off-limits at all times! They 
        cannot be attacked by other players until they are a bit more 
        capable of defending themselves. This includes assisting them 
        into an untimely demise. even indirectly, After that, its up to 
        the player to be responsible for him/herself. Note that a 
        character is not considered a 'newbie' if the human behind said 
        character plays other PCs of a level higher than 10. 

        The spirit of this rule is that new players are key to any game, 
        do not scare them off. 

    II. Exploiting bugs to build yourself an advantage is considered 
        cheating here. Players should report all bugs as soon as they 
        are discovered directly to a deity or on the forums. Using a 
        bug for personal gain is cheating and using a bug to harm other 
        players are vile crimes and will be dealt with by the gods 
        harshly. Ignorance is no excuse. 

        The spirit of this rule is that this is a game and it is meant 
        to be a fair game. If something seems too good to be true, it 
        is, and is likely a bug. Report it. Do not take the risk of 
        severe repercussions. 

   III. Absolutely zero harassment will be tolerated. While it is 
        certainly true that players are expected to fight their own 
        battles, this does not permit harassment of any sort. Any form 
        of harassment will not be tolerated. Immortality does not grant 
        immunity to this rule. People who harass other players will be 
        dealt with swiftly and firmly. 

        The spirit of this rule is that no one likes to be uncomfortable. 
        There is a reason all work places have a harassment policy in 
        place. 

        An additional explanation of this is that one may not manipulate
        aspects of the game in order to deny service to the game to
        other players out of bounds of game play. This will include 
        actions like spamming other players so they can not see and
        react to the game or normal communications. Absolutely zero 
        harassment will be tolerate.

    IV. -- RULE FOUR
          -- UPDATED October 10, 2019
        You may NEVER have more than 5 characters on at a time. EVER! 
        Cutting link does NOT remove the character from the game - they 
        remain in game for approximately 5-10 minutes until they link
        out. Having more than 5 characters rented at a time is permitted,
        you are just not permitted to have more than five playing at 
        once. Storage characters are not permitted, keep your items on 
        the characters they belong on. Character sharing is also not
        permitted and people caught sharing will be dealt with harshly. 

        The spirit of this rule is also fairness. Many MUDs allow only 
        one character simultaneously. Do not abuse our rule and use 
        more than your allotted five character limit. 

     V. No botting. This means no scripting or automating of tasks 
        that perform game play (in any fashion) for your characters 
        while you are not actively playing the game. You are 
        considered to be not actively playing if you have left you 
        computer to do other things or do not respond within 
        a few minutes or scripting is being used in place of you 
        playing the game. Idle triggers are acceptable as long as 
        the trigger uses a command that has no gameplay value; 
        such as emotes, socials, communication commands, and 
        other passive type commands. Active commands (casting, 
        using skills, etc...) are prohibited in idle triggers. 
 
        The spirit of this rule is that the game should be fair for 
        everyone; if you you're not playing the game, you shouldn't 
        get the credit for progress by using automated means. It 
        goes against the spirit of the game. Violators will, at 
        minimum, have their skills set to minimum as a punishment. 

    VI. No kill stealing. When something is wounded, make certain via 
        shout or another channel that no one is battling this creature. 
        If the creature is claimed, it is off limits. These things are 
        logged so it is verifiable if you usurp a battle. If the creature 
        fully heals, then it is fair game for you to attack. Punishment 
        will be swift to violators and those grouped with the violator. 

        The spirit of this rule is simple, no one likes putting in a lot 
        of work to have it stolen away by someone else. Don't do it. 

These laws are subject to change at any time without warning especially 
as we're adding more and more features to the game or as new situations 
arise. If you have a problem with excess killing, talk to a god. Like 
these laws? Hate them? Leave suggestions. Also, please feel free to use

LAYHANDS
 
Warriors that have selected the path of pure good or absolute evil have 
once again been granted the power of LAYHANDS. This innate skill for both 
Paladins and anti-paladins can only be used once every few mud hours.
 
For paladins, LAYHANDS will heal an intended person or harm any undead 
mob you might use it on. It will target the paladin in question if a 
target is not specified.
 
For anti-paladins, LAYHANDS will damage any non-evil, non-undead mob 
targeted for a massive amount of damage. Counter to paladins, 
anti-paladins can heal the undead with their LAYHANDS. Great for starting 
dangerous fights or finishing off an unending battle.

"LIFE FORCE"
 
The life force is that energy which motivates a creature: it is the
composition of the soul. Different kinds of life force are vulnerable
in different ways, as the following table shows.

Life force   Healing   Discorporation  Dispel Magic  Mental
==========   ========  ==============  ============  ======
Life         high      immune          immune        high

The vast majority of Fiery's denizens are motivated by life, but the 
undead throng in their lairs. Demons intrude from time to time as well. 
Celestial beings, however, are rather rare.

LIST
 
Usage: list [item type]
 
If you'd like to see what items a shop has for sale, take a look at the
LIST. The LIST contains all of the items currently for sale and in what 
quantity. The price for each item is also listed. If you are interested 
in a particular type of item, you can specify which items to LIST.
 
Examples:
 
  > list             (list all items for sale)
  > list sword       (list all swords for sale)
 
In pet shops, the owner will try to gauge your MOUNT skill, and estimate
how difficult it would be for you to control the mounts that are for 
sale. The estimates may not always be entirely accurate, but they should 
keep you from wasting your money on a beast that will be entirely too 
difficult for you to control.

the name of the creature using it. If more than one object by the same 
name exists, the caster will receive a listing of several possible 
objects. The more proficient the spellcaster is, the more objects he or 
she can locate at once.

MAGIC MANA

Magic on Fiery can consist of either spells which a sorcerer-type scribes 
into a spellbook, or else it can involve those abilities which a god has 
given his or her favored worshiper, otherwise known as cleric.

Fiery does not use mana, but a more D-n-D related CIRCLES system:
     spell circles          spell slots         spellbooks

Help files you may find useful concerning magic:
     cast      memorize     pray     forget     quick chant
     meditate  abort

For more information on a given topic, type 'help <topic>'.

To find out which spells in which circles are available to you, type 
spells with no argument.

============================================================

This spell creates a globe of invulnerability around the target, 
protecting him or her from magical harm. However, even a major globe of 
protection is not without its shortcomings, and it will only protect one 
from aggressive spells up to a certain level. MAJOR GLOBE is a quest 
spell, and it is said that there is a warmage of the north that is 
willing teach it.

and prevent them from attacking for a short period of time. Unlike BASH, 
it does not require a shield to be worn, but it can only be used while 
berserking. Like BASH, it does not work on opponents more than one size 
up or two sizes down. It does (level / 2) damage when successful.

MEDITATE

================================================
Usage   : meditate
Classes : All spellcasters    Level 1
        : Berserker            Level 50
================================================

For spellcasters, MEDITATE is used to concentrate upon spells being 
prepared. During meditation, nothing else can be done. If the caster 
tries to read a board, or look around, MEDITATE stops immediately 
and must be resumed.
 
If a caster is meditating when they first prepare a spell, meditating 
gives the caster a chance to prepare the spell in 1/2 the time that it 
would normally take. If the caster is meditating when they finish 
preparing a spell, they have a chance to prepare the spell in 1/2 the 
time the next time they prepare it.
 
The more a caster uses the meditate skill, the more proficient they 
become.
 
Example:
    If Harnak wanted to meditate upon magic missile, he would type:
    >meditate
    >memorize magic

For berserkers, MEDITATE is used to increase rage regeneration while 
resting.

MELEE

An actual fight. A "melee round" refers to one bout of you hitting the
other guy, and his response to that.

You may not get an attack every melee round. If you're casting spells, 
for example, you won't get to attack at all. Secondary attacks during 
melee can increase how much you hit the other guy for, but typically you 
can only do a secondary attack every 2 or 3 melee rounds.

MELT
 
============================================================
Usage         : cast 'melt' [<victim>]
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : yes
Aggressive    : yes
Effect        : indirect attack
Area of effect: target
Damage type   : fire
Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : fire
Classes       : Pyromancer     Circle 8
============================================================

Pyromancers learn to focus their heating abilities in any location on or 
within a potential foe. When a sorcerer of fire wants to cause 
significant internal damage to a foe they concentrate the fire within in 
order to melt the enemy from inside. MELT will cause increased damage 
versus metal, stone, and ice.

#0
MEMORIZE

Usage: memorize <spellname>

MEMORIZE allows a caster to have spells ready to use. To be able to use a 
spell the caster must memorize the spell so that they may be able to cast 
it at a later time. The memorization time of each spell depends on the 
spell level and if the cast is meditating or not.

You must be RESTING to MEMORIZE.

Example:
If Harnak wanted to memorize magic missile, he would type:
   > memorize magic missile

This places the spell magic missile into a memorization queue.

Typing memorize without argument might produce:

You have memorized the following spells:              -
                                         | Spells already in memory and 
( 1st circle)    1 - minor creation      | ready  to cast!
                                                      -
You are currently memorizing:            | Spells placed into memory 
    6 seconds: ( 1st) magic missile      | queue and either being 
     6 seconds remaining                 | memorized into memory or 
                                         | awaiting memorization time.
                                                      -
You continue your studies.               | This person is actually 
                                         | memorizing and not just 
                                         | standing around.
                                                      -
You can memorize (1)1st circle spell(s)  | How many more spells of what 
                                         | circles can still be queued 
                                         | and memorized.
                                                      -

Clerics do not use MEMORIZE. Instead they PRAY for spells.

MERCENARY
 
   Mercenaries are blades for hire. They are a ruthless bunch that do 
nothing without a price. Physically stronger and tougher than most 
rogues, mercenaries enjoy many of the abilities of Rogues with added 
combat skills like a warrior. Often working as bounty hunters, they will 
capture and claim rewards. Even if their bounty is wanted for more alive, 
don't think they will hesitate to cut a throat to make things easier.
 
Primary Attributes:   Strength, Constitution, Dexterity
Allowed Races:        Barbarian, Duergar, Dwarf, Human, Ogre, Orc, Troll
 
Experience to Level:  Average
 
     *Note:  Mercenaries are a subclass of Rogue and, as with all 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : yes
Effect        : indirect attack
Area of effect: target
Accumulative  : no

Sphere        : enchantment
Fade message  : You regain your senses.
Classes       : Illusionist      Circle 3
============================================================

When you need to distract someone, even against their will, this is the 
spell to use. A mesmerized creature will forget to attack, or to do 
anything else for that matter. They will remember who enchanted them, 
however, and not with kind thoughts...

Creatures who are fighting can be mesmerized, and will cease their 
attacks. But this spell cannot be cast by one who is currently embroiled 
in battle.

Effect        : indirect attack

Classes       : Pyromancer     Circle 11 (quest)
              : Sorcerer       Circle 10 (quest)
============================================================

*This is a in-game quest*

METEORSWAM allows a mage to reach into the heavens and rain down the
wrath of the gods themselves, crushing opponents with burning meteorites.
This is a very powerful offensive spell, capable of damaging an entire
room simultaneously.

A powerful elementalist is finally ready to teach the secrets to 
METEORSWARM. But be careful, his fiery temperament makes him difficult 
to find and deal with.

============================================================

dagger".

Classes       : Cryomancer     Circle 6
              : Pyromancer     Circle 6
              : Sorcerer       Circle 4
============================================================

A MINOR GLOBE of invulnerability by name is somewhat deceptive, but then 
again most of a sorcerer's early offensive ability is keyed off of

striking fear into potential foes. The MINOR GLOBE actually protects 
heavily against lower weaker damage spells of all kinds. It provides no 
defense for against more powerful spells.

              : Pyromancer     Circle 5
              : Sorcerer       Circle 4
============================================================

MINOR PARALYSIS, when inflicted, causes the victim failing to save to 
become paralyzed, unable to move or start combat, for a period of time. 
Since the spell is quite weak however, if attacked, melee will disrupt the 
holding power of the spell causing it to dissipate.

MIRAGE

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'mirage' [<self>]

Sphere        : fire
Fade message  : You become more visible as the heat around your body dies out.
Classes       : Pyromancer     Circle 4
============================================================

Those magic users who are learning the ways of fire can learn a method of
surrounding themselves with an intense layer of heat. This layer of heat
envelopes the pyromancer causing the waves of heat dissipating off the 
body to mask the exact location of major body parts, making them seem to 
appear slightly elsewhere. This has the benefit of making the sorcerer of 
fire a bit more difficult to actually hit.

Classes       : Illusionist      Circle 4
============================================================

Illusionists may loosen their corporeal image for a time, and send 
ghostly impressions off in any direction, while simultaneously moving in 
another. They may even stay in one place while appearing to depart.

While the spell is in effect, the caster can invoke its power by 
indicating an additional direction. The second direction is the false 
one; the caster actually moves according to the first.

Examples:

> n s
(The illusionist moves north, but appears to go south.)

> stay u
(The illusionist does not move, but appears to go up.)

> e stay
(The illusionist goes east, but appears to stay.)

MONK
 
   Monks are warriors that have learned to harness their inner powers to 
manipulate their own abilities. Monks keep pretty much to themselves, 
practicing their combat routines and meditating. They keep a neutral 
outlook on the world around them, and generally don't get involved in 
wars, politics, or other people's plans toward earthly gains. Monks 
instead use their abilities to influence the world to increase harmony 
and balance. They view the forces of good in a much better light than 
those of evil, however, due to evil's blatant disregard for life and 
harmony. Monks will always be more than happy to free an enemy from their 
earthly form and free them from their karmic mistakes.
 
Primary Attributes:   Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom
Allowed Races:        Half-Elf, Human
 
Experience to Level:  Highest
 
     *Note:  Monks are a subclass of Warrior and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.
 
     *Note:  Shortly after subclassing, it is possible for a new monk to 
             die and lose up to four levels due to switching to a new 
             experience scale from warrior. But this danger will pass 
             once the monk levels once as a monk.

MOONBEAM

Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : yes
Aggressive    : yes
Effect        : indirect attack
Area of effect: enemies of the caster
Accumulative  : no
Duration      : 2 - 8 hours
Sphere        : water
Classes       : Druid          Circle 3
============================================================

Druids can call upon sister Luna to sap the strength and befuddle the 
wits of their enemies. By casting the moonbeam spell, they direct the 
moon's cool rays to shine in great concentration upon the immediate area. 
Enemies of the druid will be severely chilled, and may even be stricken 
with a temporary form of madness. However, the blind are immune to its 
effects.

Since the source of the spell's power is the moon, it cannot be used 
indoors or in the daytime.

Classes       : Druid          Circle 10 (quest)
============================================================

Using the power of the clear night's glowing moon, the MOONWELL spell 
opens a magical portal between two locations. Entering one portal will 
transport you to the other one. The spell is cast at a player somewhere 
else in the game. MOONWELL is a quest spell, and is taught only to druids 
by the dryads of the woods.

MULTIPLAY SHARE

Players may create as many characters as they like. However, players 
should never have more than 5 characters connected simultaneously. (see 
RULES)

Note: this does not leave room or tolerance for botting. Players may use 
triggers to assist in using their characters, but in no case should a 
character be controlled entirely by triggers. Botting is prohibited, even 
if you are actively playing another character.

Also, SHARING characters is illegal and violates the spirit of gameplay. 
Characters who are given away or shared will be deleted. Note that if you 
play from multiple ISP's keep track of them because if we suspect this it 
can be verified.....

MYSTIC

THIS CLASS HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM FIERY, DO NOT ASK ABOUT IT.

Mystics are clerics that seek the path of self enlightenment as opposed 
to worshiping a being that already has it. Believing that they are all a 
thread of the universal fabric, and are one with the gods, and everything 
else around them, these great seekers of inner peace are able to pull and 
tug a few of the threads while in this limited physical form. Mystics 
spend much of their time deep in meditation discovering the ways of the 
universe and discovering their own abilities.

Primary Attributes:   Wisdom, Intelligence
Allowed Races:        Human

     *Note:  Mystics are a subclass of cleric and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

NAME NAMES LASTNAMES
 
On FieryMUD, your name has a powerful influence on how your character is 
viewed by other players, and on your role playing. It should be 
well-matched to your race and alignment, and your profession if possible. 
It should be unique and distinctive.
 
Things to avoid include:
 
1) Names that do not fit the character you are playing. Examples:
 
A human named Gruzel
A troll named Bob
A boy named Sue
An orc named Ripenthiel
 
2) Modern names. Examples: Rina John Mike Steve
 
Things that are prohibited on Fiery include:
 
1) Words found in a dictionary, and compounds. Examples: LadyJade, 
BraveBlade, ImmortalSoul, Fruitbat, Cantaloupe
 
2) Offensive words or names, whether misspelled, backwards, or from a 
foreign language. Eg: Sgurd Kcuf Emod Foutre Puta
 
3) Well-known proper names, both from Fiery and the world. Examples: 
Feyd, Conan, Zeus, Vesuvius, America, Paris
 
Names may be approved or disapproved at the discretion of our staff.
 
Players may petition for an RP last name at level 20.
 
Titles may be earned for certain feats of skill, but they will be rare.

meditation and into battle, where they say nature itself guides their

NECROMANCER
 
   Necromancers are mages that have concentrated on the magical aspects 
of death. They have the ability to slow down the process of decay in 
corpses, then create undead horrors from them. This makes the necromancer 
a very worthy adversary, being able to take the corpses of his foes and 
compelling them into his service. Great necromancers have been known to 
rip the very life essence from the bodies of their victims and 
cannibalize it to increase their own power.
 
Primary Attributes:   Intelligence, Charisma, Wisdom
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all), Human, Orc, Sverfneblin
 
Experience to Level:  Highest
 
     *Note:  Necromancers are a subclass of sorcerer and, as with all

NEWBIE

Welcome to FieryMud! We hope you will check out these topics; they are of 
special interest to new players.

First, beware of fighting in any towns. They are usually patrolled, and 
if you are caught fighting, you will usually be eradicated. In other 
words, guards now usually assist ANY mob a player attacks within a town.

Second, locate newbie areas. Try to stay out of areas that are too high 
of a level for you. If you die, you will end up in your home town, but 
your corpse and all your money and gear will drop where you died and you 
will need to go get it. Help area will show you all areas in the game. 
Each area has its own help file entry, that will give you more details on 
the area, and what quests might be available in that area.

OBJUPDATE

Usage: objupdate <player>
       objupdate all yes

Use this command to forcibly convert players' object files from the old 
binary format into ASCII format.

Conversion is automatic when a player logs in, but you may not want to 
wait that long.

Certain commands used to inspect player object files will not work on the 
old binary files, such as pscan and "show rent". So if there are any such 
files in the player directory, you'll probably want to convert them.

This command should be used whenever a player is restored from backup. 
Note that it's ok to use when the player has an ASCII object file - the 
format will be detected, and the ASCII files are skipped.

OGRE OGRES
 
Big, dumb and ugly. These greedy humanoids commonly live by ambushes, 
raids and theft or commonly found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of 
orcish parties and evil clerics. Ogres stand an average 9 to 10 feet tall 
and usually weigh around 300 to 350 pounds. Their dead yellow or dull 
blackish-brown skin (with darker colored warty bumps) and repelling odor, 
that of curdled milk, make them a gruesome-looking, if not fierce, 
opponent.
 
Ogres have a reduced skill cap on the PARRY and RIPOSTE skills due to 
their size.

room just typing open door will get you the first one of those directions 
in that order.

Open door direction works all the time...

ORC ORCS
 
Aggressive, tribal carnivores, Orcs live by the belief that expansion is 
the key to survival, ergo the many wars they rage against humans, elves, 
dwarves, and kin alike. Orcs are the most populous of the evil races. 
They fill the niche in monstrous society humans fill in more conventional 
civilizations. Their appearance varies widely due to frequent 
crossbreeding with other species and captives. In general, they resemble 
primitive humans with gray-green skin covered by coarse hair with their 
stooped posture, low jutting forehead, and snout-like nose. They average 
about 5 to 6 feet in size and often employ sniping and ambush tactics in 
combat. Stereotypically, it is rumored that orcs would rather appear 
vicious than victorious... dastardly creatures indeed!

#103
PALADIN
 
   Paladins are defenders of the weak and upholders of the faith. They 
are an elite group of warriors that have made alliances to the divine 
powers of good and are granted special abilities from that alliance. 
Paladins are able to detect the presence of evil in the world around them 
and are also granted a degree of protection from it. Paladins have been 
known to heal merely by touch, and are very quick to rescue those in 
trouble. Paladins are rarely seen without their mounts, which they have 
an uncanny relationship with, often preferring the company of such a 
mount to that of others. Paladins value Order and Virtue, and strive to 
make the world a place free of evil, chaos, and destruction. As such,  
when forced into combat with one of Good, with order and virtue, he feels 
a loss to himself, while when fighting against those of loathsome 
stature, with a tendency for malice and unjust means, they strengthen 
much more potently.
 
Paladins also have the ability to heal with a touch through the LAYHANDS 
command.
 
Primary Attributes:   Strength, Constitution
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all), Dwarf, Human
 
Experience to Level:  Above average
 
      *Note:  Paladins are a subclass of warrior and, as with all other
              subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
              degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

PALM

Usage: palm <item> <container>
       palm <item>

Drawing from their skill in concealing items, a thief may retrieve an 
object from a container or the room, hiding the action from others in the 
room, even if they can see the thief. Only one item may be palmed at a 
time. Upon failure, onlookers will become aware of the action as well as 
the attempt at subterfuge. Success depends on the user's skill in 
conceal, the item's weight, the user's Dexterity, and the item level 
versus the skill user's level.

stat will make it easier to find hidden items and mobiles.

PETITION

Usage: petition <message>

Allows a mortal to petition any or all administrators for assistance.

problems.

Times to use petition:
    >petition err.. can I have a pardon? Pretty please? I'm sorry!
    >petition Azkrael asked to speak with me as soon as I got on.

    >petition I found a typo!
    >petition Tell Gabnor I said hi! Is he around?

spell the cleric must PRAY for the spell so that they may be able to cast 
it at a later time. The PRAY time of each spell depends on the spell 
level, caster's Intelligence, and caster's Wisdom.
 
You must be RESTING to PRAY.
 
Example:
If Kozir wanted to pray cure light, he would type:
     pray cure light
 
This places the spell cure light into a memorization queue.
 
Typing pray without argument might produce:
 
You have memorized the following spells:              -
                                         | Spells already in memory and 
( 1st circle)    1 - instant death       | ready to cast!
                                                      -
You are currently praying:               | Spells placed into memory
    6 seconds: ( 1st) cure light         | queue and either being
    6 seconds remaining                  | memorized into memory
                                         |or awaiting memorization time.
                                                      -
You continue your studies.               | This person is actually 
                                         | memorizing and not just                                          
                                         | standing around.
                                                      -
You can memorize (1)1st circle spell(s)  | How many more spells of what 
                                         | circles can still be queued               
                                         | and memorized.

PRIEST
 
   Priests are clerics who have taken to the path of a good aligned 
deity. They are able to heal the wounded and cure the afflicted. They 
seek preservation and order, and have within their arsenal some of the 
most potent spells against evil, chaos and destruction. Even the most 
powerful mages of the realms are incapable of performing the awesome 
miracles of a priest. 
 
Primary Attributes:   Wisdom, Charisma
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all), Dwarf, Gnome, Half-Elf, Halfling, 
                      Human
 
Experience to Level:  Average
 
     *Note:  Priests are a subclass of cleric and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

#100
PURGE

Usage: purge [name]

Purge destroys things. If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of 
all mobiles and objects, but will not harm players. If the argument is an 
object, that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  
If the argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its 
inventory and equipment lying on the ground. 
 
If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and 
equipment will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her 
connection. For this reason, PURGE should only be used on players in 
disciplinary situations. 

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

PYROMANCER
 
   Pyromancers are mages that have melded the essence of fire with their 
own powers, giving them incredible influence over the prime element of 
fire. The element of fire is mainly associated with transmutation, and 
these mages are more than willing to transform any transgressor into a 
pile of ash. Pyromancers have been known to summon great beings of living 
flame to do their bidding, and also are seen as the ambassadors to the 
material plane from the plane of fire. Pyromancers don't have any 
problems with any other elementalists, but harbor no love for water 
elementalists. 
 
Primary Attributes:   Intelligence
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all except Frost), Gnome, Half-Elf, 
                      Halfling, Human, Orc, Sverfneblin
 
Experience to Level:  Highly Above Average
 
     *Note:  Pyromancers are a subclass of sorcerer and, as with all  
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

QUEST QUESTS

READ HELP QUEST_RULES!!

Quests on Fiery are automatic - they are run by the creatures you find 
about the realm. This is accomplished using some fancy quest code mixed 
with various other things.

Most quests currently are run under the following format, this is only a 
rough sketch of how a number of the quests (including the subclass 
quests) run.

The format is:
1) You enter the room where the Questmaster is and he says something. 
   Among the things the creature says is a keyword. Many times you must  
   say the keyword (which you must guess at) followed by a question mark.
2) The creature will probably then say something else, which you have to 
   find a different keyword, which you should follow with a question 
   mark.
3) That process might repeat some more, to get you information about the 
   quest. Eventually the creature will say something where there are no 
   more keywords, or they might suggest you leave them. That would be 
   your cue to go do what it asked you to.
4) You go do what the creature asked of you, kill someone, get something, 
   whatever.
5) Sometimes whatever they had you do is the prize, other times they give 
   you something in order to achieve your prize, and yet other times they 
   want you to come back and say something specific or give them 
   something, to redeem your prize.

Example:
You enter Rogga's room.
Rogga says, 'Me big talking Creature, you not.'
You say, 'Creature?'
Rogga says, 'Yes Creature, me make you do things.'
You say, 'Things?'
Rogga says, 'Yes things, big hard things, go get big box'
You say, 'Box?'
Rogga says, 'Yes, box I lost long ago, go get for me. You go now.'
Then you leave Rogga's room to get the box from where ever it may be.
If you don't know where it is, then that is part of your quest, to learn.
Come back to Rogga's room with box in hand.
give box rogga
Rogga says, 'Thanks, here your prize.'


The alternatives to the above format are not vastly different. The fact 
that you have to run off and perform some task can be much the same.
 
The alternative format is:
1) You enter the room where the Questmaster is and he says nothing. 
   He/she/it could be a creature you've seen thousands of times all over 
   the mud. But, little known to you, it is programmed to interact with a 
   particular class or race or everyone in an unexpected way.
2) There are several ways to interact with the creature to have it 
   indicate that it may be more than it appears. Saying words aloud is 
   one way, the other ways are whisper and ask. Note that whisper and ask 
   accomplish the same thing so if you ask a creature hello and it 
   doesn't respond then you won't have to whisper hello to double check.
3) A simple greeting like hello or hi will sometimes kick off the quest
   introduction banter. After that, the rest of the quest will resemble 
   the above procedure except that you may have to use ask or whisper 
   instead of say.

"QUEST COMMAND"
 
Usage: quest advance <questname> <playername>
       quest complete <questname> <playername>
       quest erase <questname> <playername>
       quest fail <questname> <playername>
       quest restart <questname> <playername>
       quest rewind <questname> <playername>
       quest stage <questname> <playername>
       quest start <questname> <playername> [subclass]
       quest variable <questname> <playername> <varname> <varvalue>
 
This command is used to manage players' in-game quests. Valid quest names 
are listed using the command qlist. Quest start may only be used for 
quests the player has not already started. Conversely, the other quest 
commands may only be used for quests the player has already started. For 
example, trying to fail a quest on a player if he or she has not started 
it will cause an error. A player's quests can be listed using the stat 
command.
 
The quest command is also used in triggers to automate in-game quests. It 
should probably not be used at the prompt except to manually fix quest 
errors.
 
QUEST ADVANCE increases the player's stage in a given quest by one. 
Attempting to advance the quest stage past the quest's maximum stage or 
attempting to advance a completed or failed quest will cause an error.
 
QUEST COMPLETE sets a given quest on a player to complete, preventing the 
player from starting the quest again. Subsequent attempts to advance, 
complete, start, fail, or rewind a completed quest will cause an error.
 
QUEST ERASE removes the quest from a player, allowing the player to start 
the quest again. It will be like the player never started the quest.
 
QUEST FAIL sets a given quest on a player to failed, preventing the 
player from starting the quest again. Subsequent attempts to advance, 
complete, fail, or rewind a failed quest will cause an error.
 
QUEST RESTART sets the given quest's stage back to 1. The effect is 
similar to a quest erase followed by a quest start, except quest 
variables will remain.
 
QUEST REWIND decreases the player's stage in a quest by one. Attempting 
to rewind the quest stage below 1 or to rewind a completed or failed 
quest will cause an error.
 
QUEST STAGE simply shows a player's stage in a quest. To access quest 
stages in triggers, use a variable call similar to 
%actor.quest_stage[questname]%. This variable call will return 0 for 
unstarted and failed quests. To find out whether a player has failed or 
completed a quest, use variable calls like %actor.has_failed[questname]% 
and %actor.has_completed[questname]%.
 
QUEST START initializes a quest on a player, setting their stage to 1, if 
the player has not already started the quest. For a subclass quest, a 
quest start command will have an extra parameter on the end, denoting the 
three-character name of subclass, such as Ant. The subclass must a valid 
one for that player's class, or quest start will fail. There should be no 
reason to use the subclass feature of the quest command, as in-game 
subclass quests are implemented and work fine.
 
QUEST VARIABLE allows the setting of quest variables on a player. They 
can be used to hold any kind of string or numerical value. Quest 
variables may be accessed within triggers using the call 
%actor.quest_var[questname:varname]%. Uninitialized quest variables will 
return 0. Unfortunately, quest variables cannot be accessed outside of 
triggers.

QUEST_RULES

Within the realm of FieryMUD there are four major quest types: zone 
quests, subclass quests, spells quests, and equipment quests.
 
Zone quests are often the central focus of a zone and totally NPC-driven. 
These quests often, though not always, tell the story of a zone and guide 
a character through the action of the area. They require interacting with 
several NPCs, collecting a number of items from around the zone or 
possibly across the MUD, killing a few select creatures, and culminating 
in receiving a significant piece of equipment. These quests include the 
phase armor creation granted by guild masters and other significant NPCs 
across the world. They are never granted by gods.
 
Subclass quests are those quests in which a base class character may earn 
the right to advance into a more specialized field. These quests are 
meant to challenge the individual as they prove that they are truly 
worthy to hold the rank of that specialized class. This means that the 
person questing must earn their new rank. Currently all subclass quests 
are run in-game by NPCs. However, gods may grant subclass quests if 
players are seeking something unique or challenging.
 
Spell quests are those quests either given through mob interaction
or through divine intervention. These quests are usually an attempt to 
test the quester's knowledge of the MUD and skill within their class. We
ask that you not ruin these quests by providing the answers to whatever
riddle or supplying the quester with any knowledge that would remove the
challenge from the quest. You may however provide clues or hints. 
Deity-granted quests are often quite a bit harder than in-game NPC 
quests.
 
Equipment quests are all granted directly by gods to players seeking 
either elite or totally unique pieces of gear. Such equipment can be 
simple re-skins of existing equipment, slightly modified existing gear, 
an item from a reserved set of extremely powerful equipment, or something 
totally unique. Players of any level may quest for equipment, with 
challenges and rewards commensurate to their current level. Equipment 
quests tend to be extremely difficult. Often they include collections of 
in-game items and mobs with shared keywords, many of which are extremely 
difficult to find or discern. These quests will often require assistance 
from other characters, but will be limited to characters within a 
reasonable level band.

QUEST_SPELLS "QUEST SPELLS"
 
As players become more experienced and farther along their journey 
through the realm of FieryMUD, they will be able to quest for additional 
and more powerful spells. These spells may be available through automated 
in-game quests or through deity-assigned quests. Currently all spell 
quests are run through in-game NPCs. Monk quest chants are only granted 
through deity-assigned quests.

available and at what circle you may quest for them.

RACE RACES
 
A race is a sort of humanoid that possesses sentience and can adventure 
in FieryMUD to gain exp and levels and neat stuff. All races listed here
are currently available, though not always as starting races. 
 
Your choice of race influences several factors, including your stat 
maximums, combat capability, hit points, base alignment, and more. Many 
races have a variety of innate skills and abilities that may be more or 
less helpful depending on your class choice.
 
Not all races can become all classes -- in fact, many are severely 
limited. You can type SUBCLASS to find out what classes are available to 
the race you currently play, if you are of the correct level to do so. 
 
     *Note: This command only works some of the time. If you do not see 
            any subclasses available, try looking at the help file on 
            your class (help subclass_warrior, help subclass_rogue, etc.)
 
To become an evil race, you must petition to the gods and complete a 
minor quest before being allowed to have an evil race character.
 
Starting races, the good races, include:
    Human         Gnome
    Half-Elf      Halfling
    Barbarian     Mountain Dwarf
    Dragonborn
 
Evil races are:
    Orc           Swamp Troll
    Duergar       Ogre
    Sverfneblin

RACEWAR
&2(inactive entry - concept retired from design)&0

One of Fiery's primary goals is to create a challenging, yet not 
balanced, pk system that allows most players to go about their business
while allowing others the opportunity to engage their characters against
others'. To that end, we have created the racewar.

Any player may freely destroy another character (if she can), if that
other character is of a race coded as hostile to the player's. In other
words, orcs may freely attack elves, elves may attack orcs or dwarves,
trolls may attack halflings, etc. No race may kill its own.

Since most races will not mingle with others (it being difficult and
time-consuming to go far), and since the justice system employed by Fiery
punishes those who do attack other characters, this more or less ensures
that if someone does choose to pkill/psteal, she has given this matter
extensive thought and thoroughly developed her character.

RANGER
 
   Rangers, like paladins, are warriors of Virtue, but seek the 
preservation of nature. They are good warriors opposed to the forces of 
destruction and evil. Rangers must stay in good graces with nature, and 
if they fall into the ranks of evil, will lose all powers granted them 
from nature. Rangers have a relationship with animals that compares to 
their relationship with people, and are able to make friends in the 
animal kingdom easier than they do with other people. Rangers are able to 
move about outdoors with incredible stealth, and are able to detect the 
passage of any being through any area.
 
Primary Attributes:   Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence
Allowed Races:        Half-Elf, Human
 
Experience to Level:  Above Average
 
     *Note:  Rangers are a subclass of warrior and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

of whom Bigby is one.

REMORT REMORTING REBIRTH REMORTAL

Please note that as of right now, there are very few people who can 
actually start you on one of these quests, so it may take a while for a 
request to be processed.
 
Rules for Remort
 
Qualifying for Remorting
Any persons looking to remort must fit the following qualifications:
1) One remort char will be allowed for each person at the following 
   intervals:
      4 completed chars, one of each base class type
      9 completed chars
      14 completed chars
      17 completed chars, meaning one of each class (at this stage the
      only restriction is that only 1 char may remort at a time).

      By "completed", it means a ** character with all possible quest 
      spells (as applicable).
 
2) The questee must prove their knowledge of the realm by answer

   10 MUD knowledge questions from a list of 100. These will be randomly 
   chosen and given after verification of other qualifications.
 
3) The char that shall be remorted must have a minimum of 2 weeks
   (336 hours). Playtime with all other "completed" chars is a minimum of 
   100 hours playtime.
 
4) Must not have any outstanding quests on any chars. You may not start 
   new spell/eq quests while one of your characters is on a remort quest, 
   except spell quests for the remort character.
 
 
Remort Rules
1) A grouping restriction of no more than 5 levels above the remorting 
   char shall remain in effect. This includes help of any kind including 
   transportation such as MOONWELL, corpse retrieval such as RESURRECTION 
   and SHIFT CORPSE, and support such as INVISIBILITY, STONESKIN etc. 
   However, feel free to group with those within the accepted level 
   range, which includes all characters of lower level than the remort.
 
2) To be considered "completed" in regards to the remort, the char must 
   re-quest for and complete ALL possible spell quests. (Quests are 
   considered part of leveling up a char and thus must be completed 
   during remort as well.)
 
Failure to comply with these rules will be a demotion back to level 1 and 
no benefits upon regaining ** status. In other words, failing to respect 
these rules is failing to respect the remort quest and result in 
revocation of the privilege.
 
  
Reward for a Successfully Completed Remort
The character will be given:
 
1) All maxed stats.
 
2) All maxed skills for their class. Spells must be re-quested for as 
   noted in the Rules section.
 
3) 50% additional HP (based on their L99 hp before maxed stats and 
   without eq). This means that if you have 950 as a ** without eq before 
   remorting, your bonus would be 475 for a new total of 1475 (assuming 
   you rolled the same amount of hp the second time through).
 
4) The person shall be given access to the evil races choices for their 
   next char set. You may still quest for evil characters in the usual 
   way, but this is an added bonus for completing the remort quest.
 
 
 
If there are any questions, please contact your local deity for more 
information.

REPLY

Usage: reply <message>

This command will send a reply to the last person to send you a message
using TELL. It works just as if you had typed TELL <player> <message>
but makes it a bit easier. You do not need to be able to see the speaker 
to use REPLY. It can also be very useful in case someone hidden or 
invisible sends you a message.

Examples:

Ras tells you, 'Hi!'
> reply hey
You tell Ras, 'hey'
 
Someone tells you, 'I am your secret admirer.'
> reply Who are you?

           : Ranger         Level 35
           : Warrior        Level 15
================================================
 
As a general rule in a group, the person who takes the first hit will
receive most or all of the damage from the opponent. This is called 
"tanking." Often, this person will become low on hit points and will need 
to be RESCUED. To RESCUE someone is to attempt to take the place of that 
person and have the monster hit you instead. You can only redirect one 
opponent for each RESCUE attempt. Succeed or fail, there will be a short 
delay after each RESCUE attempt.

RESURRECT

============================================================

Min. position : standing

Effect        : support
Area of effect: target

              : Priest         Circle 11 (quest)
============================================================

*This is a in-game quest spell*

The RESURRECT spell returns a player to life at the site of their corpse, 
restoring a portion of the experience they lost at the time of death. The 
caster of the spell must be in the same room as the corpse, and be able 
to see it. The player to be resurrected must be online, in the game, and 
also visible to the caster. When the target player is resurrected, all 
items in the corpse will be placed in his/her inventory. 
 
A powerful necromancer, seeking for ages to gain power over death, 
eventually found that the power could only be attained through clerical 
magic. His pursuit of this knowledge has rendered him  unable to die, and 
he exists in eternal misery, despite his immense power. The unholy church 
that provided his immortality, is now his prison. He admires clerics for 
their healing powers, and is willing to train them if he can be found!

           : Warrior        Level 60
================================================
 
Sometimes things get just a little too heated in a fight, and one might 
find it necessary to get out of harm's way. Those especially skilled at 
combat can learn techniques to safely retreat from battle when FLEE is 
too risky. When using RETREAT, the player must give the direction to make 
a RETREAT attempt towards.

RIDING RIDE
 
This is the skill of horsemanship. The better you are, the less likely it 
is that you will fall to the ground or be thrown off. Use the MOUNT 
command to get on, and then just move around normally, by entering the 
cardinal direction in which you wish to move.
 
Pet shops owners will try to indicate how easy a mount would be for you
to control when you type LIST.

ROGUE
 
   Rogues are miscreants of all types: Burglars, beggars, and 
pick-pockets. Rogues make their living off those that make a living. Not 
above killing or being selfish, some rogues find this path to be all they 
need. Some rogues have been known to forget specializing and after they 
have learned all they can go on to learn an entirely different 
profession.
 
   Rogues and their subclasses do not cast spells and require no 
additional preparation after starting. Unless they subclass to mercenary, 
they are much less survivable than warriors and are not intended to be 
tanks or front-line fighters. They work best as support characters in 
groups.
 
Primary Attributes:   Dexterity, Constitution
Allowed Races:        Barbarian, Duergar, Dwarf, Gnome, Half-Elf, 
                      Halfling, Human, Ogre, Orc, Troll, Sverfneblin

SAVE

Usage: save

This command has been disabled due to abuse...BAD MORTALS!

Save your persona. This includes experience points, Strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash. The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not 
necessary to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

See also: INN, RENT
#0
"SAVING THROWS" "SAVING SPELL" "ROD" "PAR" "BRE" "SPE" "PET"

These are the saving throws. The LOWER the number the better chance you
have at resisting a spell that is being cast at you. You will be unable 
to see your saving throws until you achieve a certain level.

PAR: paralysis - how well you resist immobilizing spells and effects.
     A successful save ignores the effect.
ROD: rod/wand - how well you resist someone using a magic item on you.
     A successful save either ignores the effect or reduces damage by 
     half.
PET: petrification - currently not implemented 
BRE: breath - ever have a dragon burn you to a crisp with their breath? 
     This helps with that. A successful save reduces damage by half.
SPE: spell - how well you resist direct damage spells. 
     In general, a successful save reduces damage by half.
     Note: Some spells cannot be saved against unless you somehow dodge 
           them.
#0
SAY TELL WHISPER SHOUT '

Usage: say | shout
       tell | whisper <player> <string>

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either SAY, TELL, WHISPER, or SHOUT.

SAY broadcasts your message to everyone in your room.

WHISPER speaks to a specific person in you room and displays a message to 
the room that you have WHISPERED to that person. It is functionally 
identical to ASK.

TELL speaks to a specific person anywhere in the game.

SHOUT broadcasts your message to everyone in your geographic zone. You 
must be level 2 before you can use SHOUT.

Examples:

  > say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:

  > ' hello there.

NPCs will respond to any SAY, WHISPER, ASK, or TELL in the same way.

See also: ASK, GSAY, NOREPEAT, QSAY, REPLY, PETITION, GOSSIP, LARYNGITIS
#0
SCAN

Usage: scan
       scan <direction>

Scan allows you to see who is in the surrounding rooms. It will list the 
inhabitants of adjacent rooms and a rough description of their stance. 
Most people will only be able to see one room away, but rogues and 
assassins typically have well-trained eyesight, allowing them to see 
three rooms away. However, the FARSEE spell can increase this distance as 
much as three rooms, depending on the &8user's&0 proficiency in the 
sphere of divination.

You can also supply a direction when scanning that limits your scan to 
that direction.

Currently, you cannot see mobiles and players in dark rooms.

See also: FARSEE LOOK
#0
SCORE
 
Usage: score
 
Provides useful information on your status such as age, hit points, 
movement points, Armor Class, alignment, experience points, gold on hand, 
gold in the bank, how long you've been playing, your level, and active 
spells, among other things.
 
Many statistics have a non-numeric description associated with the actual 
value; some of these descriptions are only shown until the character 
reaches a certain level. For instance, characters below level 10 will see 
abilities (Strength, Wisdom, etc.) as "Fantastic", "Pretty Good", "Not 
Bad", "Fair, and "Bad", rather than actual numbers. As another example, 
alignment's numeric value is always shown, but below level 35, alignment 
will also be described as "Good", "Neutral", or "Evil".
 
Your experience towards the next level is shown near the bottom of the 
score page in two forms: first, a verbal description of your progress 
and, second, a colored bar showing a more precise measurement. This bar 
is 60 ticks long, and the "=" symbols designate how far you are towards 
your next level. The "*" symbol designates how far you are within a 
single larger tick. (So, every tick of "=" indicates 1/60 of a level, 
while every space the "*" moves to the right indicates 1/3600 of a 
level.)

Usage   : scribe <spellname>
          -- where <spellname> is the complete name of the spell. 
Classes : Conjurer, Cryomancer, Necromancer, Pyromancer, Ranger,
           Sorcerer
=======================================================================

SCRIBE is used by sorcerers (and subclasses) to keep a written copy of
each spell in their spellbook. The spellbook is an integral part of the
spell MEMORIZATION process, and each spell must be SCRIBE into a 
spellbook before the sorcerer can memorize the spell. 

To SCRIBE a spell, the spellbook and quill must be HELD.

NOTE: Abbreviations are accepted for spell names. However, since many 
      spells have similar abbreviations, they may conflict with what 
      actually gets written in the spellbook.

Scribing must be done at one's guild - your guild master knows all of 
your class's spells and is ready to teach them. To SCRIBE in your guild, 
HOLD your spellbook and a quill, SIT or REST, and type SCRIBE 
<spellname>. To see what spells are currently scribed in your spellbook, 
just LOOK at the spellbook.

SEARCH

Usage: search
       search <container>
       search <doorname>

SEARCH allows you to find things that are hidden beyond your perceptive 
ability. Each time you SEARCH, you remove hide points from any hidden 
items or people in the location you are searching. When their hide points 
drop below your Perception stat, they become visible. A thorough SEARCH 
of a room is also necessary to reveal hidden or secret doors, which 
cannot be passed through until made visible.
 
Using the search command without parameters merely searches the room,
and will reveal hidden mobiles, players, objects, and doors. If the
name of a hidden door in the room is known, SEARCHING for that keyword
specifically will cause it to be found immediately. SEARCHING in a
container allows discovery of hidden objects inside.

Examples:
    search bag
    search trapdoor

SEDIT

Usage: sedit <shop's virtual number>

This will set up a new shop in OLC, or edit one already defined. SHOW
SHOPS will define what shops are already set up (Fiery convention 
dictates that the vnum of the shop will be the same as its room vnum, to 
keep things easier). 

To set up a shop, you need to have: the vnum of the shopkeeper, the vnum
of the shop's room(s), the vnums of all objects to be sold. You must also
define hours of operation (if desired) and buy/sell messages.

"SEED OF DESTRUCTION"
 
===============================================
Usage          : chant 'seed of destruction'
Area of Effect : Room
Aggressive     : yes
Accumulative   : no
Duration       : Proficiency
Classes        : Monk           Level 99
===============================================
 
Especially skilled monks become so crafty at mental persuasion that they 
become able to convince others of complete falsehoods. This chant plants 
the belief in the victim that they are extremely ill, causing them to 
weaken in Constitution and Strength. Mind over matter indeed. This is a 
quest chant.
 
See also: MONK, SONGS_MONK
#0
SELL

Usage: sell [#] <item>
       sell <#>.<item>

If you'd like to SELL an item to a shopkeeper, trying SELLING it to them.
Most shops specialize in what they will buy, so you may have to look 
around to find a buyer for your items.
 
Examples:
 
  > sell sword       (sell the first sword in your inventory)
  > sell 3 sword     (sell the first three swords in your inventory)

For now, shopkeepers seem uninterested in buying anything, including
items they have sold. Hopefully they will be more interested in the
near future!

"SENSE LIFE"

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'sense life' [<self>]
Min. position : sitting
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : support
Area of effect: caster
Accumulative  : refresh
Duration      : 17 - 50 hours
Sphere        : divination
Fade message  : You feel less aware of your surroundings.
Classes       : Cleric         Circle 4
              : Diabolist      Circle 4
              : Priest         Circle 4
              : Ranger         Circle 7
============================================================

This spell will enable you to sense hidden life forms in a room. 
Creatures affected by INVISIBILITY and/or HIDE (i.e., hiding) will appear 
as definite life forms, although you will be unable to discern their true 
nature.

#0
SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of 
aspects of characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on. If you use SET 
FILE on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost. If you wish 
to set a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once 
with the FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change 
takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

To set skill levels, use the SKILLSET command.

SEVERANCE

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'severance'
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : yes
Aggressive    : yes
Effect        : indirect attack
Area of effect: enemies of the caster
Damage type   : discorporate
Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : generic
Classes       : Illusionist    Circle 10
============================================================

Illusionists may grasp at the very magical anchors that bind together
constructed and nonliving beings with this spell. The very cords that
tie life to matter are directly attacked. All present are affected, 
unless they are animated by life itself.

This is the area spell of DISCORPORATE, doing grave damage to magically
constructed enemies and harming even elementals.

SHADOW
 
================================================
Usage      : shadow <victim>
           : shadow self
           : shadow
Aggressive : no
Classes    : Rogue          Level 60
           : Assassin       Level 40
================================================
 
Those who operate in darkness often find the need to follow targets 
without their knowledge. The shadow skill accomplishes this by working 
similar to the FOLLOW command, but suppressing any indication to the 
victim and room when successful. Upon failure, onlookers will become
aware of the shadower's subterfuge, and the shadower may be forced into
visibility if HIDDEN. The skill works while HIDDEN or SNEAKING, but
onlookers will still be aware of sneaking movements if they have sense
life.

"SHADOWS SORROW SONG"

===============================================
Usage          : chant 'shadows sorrow song'
Area of Effect : Room
Aggressive     : yes
Accumulative   : no
Duration       : Proficiency
Classes        : Monk           Level 30
===============================================

This song fills the monk's victims with sorrowful depression, clouding 
their vision with shadows and hindering their ability to make melee 
attacks.

SHAMANS

   Shaman are the manipulators of the spirit realms, utilizing the 
spirits of nature to accomplish many feats, these uncivilized work with 
the raw power around them to harm, heal and manipulate. Some Shaman 
forget choosing a Totem and continue to dabble with the spirit world 
until they learn all they can and go on to learn an entirely different 
profession.

Allowed Races:          Troll, Ogre, Orc, Barbarian

No one seems sure what Shamans do. This is uncharted territory.

SHAPECHANGE
 
Usage:
  shapechange mammal | bird | reptile | fish | aquatic
  shapechange tank | damager | tracker | travel
  shapechange <animal>
  shapechange me
  shapechange
 
SHAPECHANGE is a druid innate skill. It will change you into an animal 
whose power depends on your level and dedication to neutrality. Various 
animals will have different skills available.
 
There are three ways to specify what you want to SHAPECHANGE into. You 
can specify the animal class (mammal, bird, reptile, or fish), the job 
(tank, damager, tracker, or travel), or a specific animal by name.
 
For instance, to randomly pick a bird shapechange, you could simply type 
SHAPECHANGE BIRD to get the strongest bird possible to your level and 
alignment.
 
But if you knew you wanted to be a golden eagle, you could type 
SHAPECHANGE EAGLE. However, in this case, there is no guarantee you will 
be able to turn into an eagle. If your level or neutrality are not 
sufficient, you might SHAPECHANGE into a lesser bird instead.
 
Specifying an animal job will attempt to pick the strongest possible 
animal in that job for your level and alignment, regardless of animal 
class. For instance, SHAPECHANGE DAMAGER might get you a panther or it 
might get you a cobra. If you're really unlucky, you might turn into a 
rat.
 
When shapechanged, to change back to yourself, type SHAPECHANGE ME.
Using the SHAPECHANGE command without arguments while shapechanged
will tell you how long you have been shapechanged.
  
In addition to the four animal classes, there is the aquatic pseudoclass. 
It includes all the fish and certain other water-only animals. You can 
only SHAPECHANGE into an aquatic animal when in the water. These aquatic 
animals will be unable to leave the water and enter land rooms.
 
The animals available, in order of increasing power in each class and
job, are as follows:
 
MAMMALS
  rabbit, rat, bat, horse, badger, manatee, wolf, panther, dolphin,
  bear, cheetah, rhino, orca
 
BIRDS
  sparrow, bluebird, robin, owl, hawk, falcon, buzzard,
  eagle, ostrich
 
REPTILES
  snake, lizard, chameleon, asp, tortoise, cobra, turtle,
  viper, crocodile, anaconda
 
FISH
  piranah, eel, swordfish, stingray, lamprey, shark
 
AQUATIC
  piranah, eel, swordfish, stingray, manatee, lamprey, dolphin,
  turtle, shark, orca
 
DAMAGER
  rat, piranah, lizard, eel, rabbit, falcon, lamprey, eagle,
  panther, cobra, cheetah, ostrich, viper,
 
TRAVEL
  sparrow, bluebird, bat, robin, owl, swordfish, raven, hawk,
  horse, dolphin
 
TANK
  chameleon, badger, tortoise, manatee, turtle, bear, rhino,
  crocodile, anaconda, orca
 
TRACKER
  snake, asp, stingray, buzzard, wolf, shark

"SHIFT CORPSE"

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'shift corpse' <corpse>
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : transit
Area of effect: realm
Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : summoning
Classes       : Necromancer    Circle 13 (quest)
============================================================

SUMMON CORPSE's bigger brother, SHIFT CORPSE allows the caster to commune
with death and transport a player's corpse from anywhere within the realm
and bring it to the caster's feet. In order to be successful, the caster
must have the consent of the player whose corpse is being summoned. This
is a quest spell.

To find this in-game quest, here is a hint:
Not even the greatest masters of necromancy can teach SHIFT CORPSE. But 
they probably have a pretty good idea where to start.

"SHOCKING GRASP"

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'shocking grasp' [<victim>]
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : yes
Aggressive    : yes
Effect        : contact attack
Area of effect: target
Damage type   : shock
Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : air
Classes       : Cryomancer     Circle 3
              : Necromancer    Circle 3
              : Ranger         Circle 5
              : Sorcerer       Circle 3
============================================================
 
The spell caster attempts to grasp the enemy with a bare hand, but for
only the briefest of instants. On contact, the target is blasted with a 
searing shock of electricity, causing great pain.

SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his 
quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive 
the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a 
specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your 
armor, even if it is of high quality!
 
Shopkeepers seem uninterested in all types of items for now. Hopefully, 
their interest will be piqued in the future!

SHOW
 
Usage: show <mode> [argument]
 
The SHOW command displays information. Some modes of show require 
additional information, such as a player name. See help SHOW <mode> for 
more information on a particular mode.
 
Available modes:
 classes: List all classes.
   death: Show all death traps in the game.
  errors: Show errant rooms.
     exp: List exp required to gain each level for a particular class.

  player: Show player summary information, simply provide a player name.
   races: List all races.
    rent: List the contents of a player's rent file.
   shops: Show all the shops in the game and their buy/sell parameters.
   snoop: Show everyone being snooped, and who's doing the snooping.

when you look in the room, in containers, in your inventory, at people's 
equipment--almost everywhere!
 
See also: TOGGLE, ROOMFLAGS, HOLYLIGHT
#100
SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down. The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction 
with CircleMUD's 'autorun' script. If you are not using autorun, the 
arguments are meaningless. If you are using autorun, the following 
arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun 
           is explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do 
           not try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.

NOW        Just like reboot 'cept shutdown now will shutdown without 
           saving characters or olc info.

SILENCE

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'silence' [<victim>]
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : yes
Aggressive    : yes
Effect        : indirect attack
Area of effect: target

              : Priest         Circle 6
============================================================

This spell will allow the caster to prevent the victim from speaking. 
This has the effect of preventing the victim from casting.

SIMULACRUM

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'simulacrum' [<target>]
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : summoning
Area of effect: target
Duration      : 3 - 28 hours
Sphere        : summoning
Classes       : Illusionist    Circle 5
============================================================

Like the phantasm spell, simulacrum summons an illusory being. However, 
it can mimic nearly any creature in the realm. More powerful beings are 
more difficult to imitate.

These phantasms lack the ability to harm anyone or to interact with 
material objects.

SIZE
 
The size of a player or mob can affect many things. Smaller races tend to 
have fewer hit points and could even be knocked over by heavy winds if 
they are not careful. Larger races, on the other hand, tend to be blessed 
with better health and can withstand much more punishment as a result. 
Some skills affected by size are listed below.
 
*You can only THROATCUT a mob within one size category of yourself.
*You can only BASH a mob within one size category of yourself.
 
Some approximations of sizes in the MUD and examples are:
Small: 2'-3'     ex: a gnome
Medium: 4'-7'    ex: a human
Large: 8'-15'    ex: a barbarian
Huge: 16'-31'    ex: a frost giant
Giant: 32'-63'    ex: a remorhaz
Gargantuan: 64'+ ex: Sagece of Raymif
 
Note that mobs with a high weight can be of a higher size than their 
height may suggest. This is why dwarves are medium and halflings are 
small, even though a tall halfling might be about the same height as a 
short dwarf.

SKILL SKILLS
 
Usage: skill skills
 
Use this command to get a list of your skills and an indication of your  
proficiency in them.
 
Unlike in most other MUDs and past iterations of Fiery, Fiery DOES NOT 
currently use a training/practice system for skills or spells.
 
Most skills must be exercised in order to improve, but you can only 
improve them a certain amount per level. Skill proficiency ranges from 
'Awful' to 'Mastered'. The describing word DOES NOT USUALLY CHANGE when 
you improve your skills. When you've maximized your proficiency in a 
skill for your current level, an asterisk ('*') will appear next to it. 
When a skill is as good as it's ever going to get, two hyphens will 
appear as well ('-*-').

SLEEP

SLEEP is both a command and the name of a spell.

The SLEEP command puts you to sleep, allowing you to regain your health 
more quickly. You will be largely unaware of your surroundings while 
asleep. You can awaken yourself with the WAKE command.

The SLEEP spell forces the victim into a magical sleep such that they 
cannot be awakened until the spell wears off.

Classes       : Pyromancer     Circle 3
============================================================
 
Sorcerers who have mastered fire have mastered all forms of it. Those who 
do can manipulate a targeted flow of pyroclastic ash to blind their foes 
causing intense pain and the normal side effects associated with 
blindness.

SNEAK
 
================================================
Usage      : <automatic when moving while hidden>

           : Rogue        Level 1
           : Thief        Level 1
================================================
 
When attempting to move while HIDDEN, you will normally lose a certain 
amount of HIDDENNESS points per step. Higher proficiency in the SNEAK 
skill helps decrease the chance that this will occur. 
 
See also: STEALTH, HIDE, MOVEMENT, PERCEPTION
#0
SNOOP

Usage: snoop <player>|<descriptor>

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the 
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a 
'%'.

You can choose a descriptor to snoop by entering "snoop #", where "#" is 
the number of a connection descriptor. The descriptors are listed by the 
"users" command.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this 
command; snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary 
purposes.

Type snoop to stop snooping.

SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.
Of course, Zzur took it away, so we should all cry then gather arms and
slay Zzur!

SOCIALS

Usage: <social> [<victim>]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others. The 
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages. Generally, 
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action, 
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on 
the social. (Slap a dragon lately?)

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available 
socials.

"SONATA OF MALAISE"
 
===============================================
Usage          : chant 'sonata of malaise'
Area of Effect : Room
Aggressive     : yes
Accumulative   : no
Duration       : Proficiency
Classes        : Monk           Level 60
===============================================
 
One of the monk's most devious chants, SONATA OF MALAISE invokes such a 
sense of anger and fear that it hampers the monk's opponents movements 
such that they are less likely to dodge certain spell effects. This chant 
hurts all of the victims' saves.

SORCERER
 
   Sorcerers are dabblers in the arcane realms. They reach into various 
aspects of magic, taking and leaving knowledge as they see fit, painting 
a broad palette of spells for their personal use. Some sorcerers have 
been known to forget specializing and after learning all they can go on 
to learn an entirely different profession.

   For new players, casting sorcerer spells can be tricky at first. 
First, a player must find their guild master. Once they have done so, 
they must HOLD their spellbook and quill and SIT or REST with their guild 
master. All new sorcerer characters start with a spellbook and quill in 
their inventory. Then, they can SCRIBE any spell they have access to - 
the SPELL command will show the list of spells currently known. Once a 
spell is scribed in a spellbook, a player can REST and MEDITATE, then 
MEMORIZE the spell. They can CAST the spell once it has been memorized. 
After the spell has been cast, they will need to MEMORIZE it again. All 
sorcerer subclasses use the same scribe-memorize-cast flow of play.
 
Primary Attributes:   Intelligence, Wisdom
Allowed Races:        Dragonborn (all), Gnome, Half-Elf, Halfling, Human, 
                      Orc, Sverfneblin
 
Experience to Level:  Highly Above Average

"SOUL REAVER"

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'soul reaver'
Min. position : standing

Effect        : indirect attack
Area of effect: enemies of the caster
Damage type   : mental
Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : death
Classes       : Illusionist      Circle 12
============================================================

Where nightmare convinces a single enemy that ruin is at hand, this spell 
brings apocalyptic visions to all within range of the caster. Skin 
spontaneously tears, blood flows freely, and bones crack under the weight 
of sheer horror in those unfortunate enough to believe what is shown.

This is the area spell of NIGHTMARE.

"SOUL TAP"

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'soul tap' [<victim>]
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : yes

Effect        : contact attack
Area of effect: target
Damage type   : heal
Duration      : 5 rounds
Sphere        : death
Classes       : Necromancer    Circle 9
============================================================
 
Like an advanced form of energy drain, this spell allows a necromancer to 
leech energy from a living victim's very soul, causing the victim 
significant anguish. This drain has a prolonged effect, which occurs over 
a few combat rounds.

Effect        : support
Area of effect: caster
Accumulative  : no
Duration      : 2 - 12 hours
Sphere        : protection
Fade message  : The aura guarding your body fades away.
Classes       : Anti-Paladin   Circle 8

              : Paladin        Circle 8
              : Priest         Circle 5
============================================================

For a wise and very devout cleric this spell, like its arcane 
counterparts fireshield and coldshield, will reflect damage back upon an 
attacker. This spell will only be effective upon foes of the cleric who 
are of opposite and extreme alignment. The foe will be burned for their 
lack of faith in the following of the gods of the righteous who are 
protected by a soulshield.

SPELL_CIRCLE CIRCLE_SPELL

Those who cast spells by either memorizing them or from god granted 
abilities will potentially gain spells every eight levels. This will 
occur at the following intervals:

Circle: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13
Level:  1  9  17 25 33 41 49 57 65 73  81  89  97

Some classes may not get spells every circle, others may get an 
abundance. It all depends on the interdependence of the class and how it 
integrates into the class structure.

"SPELL KNOWLEDGE"
 
================================================
Usage      : Involuntary
Aggressive : N/A
Classes    : All spellcasters
================================================
 
SPELL KNOWLEDGE is a measure of how well a character understands the 
coded language of spells.
 
When casting a spell, the name of the spell is scrambled through a 
conventional cipher, resulting in gibberish words to disguise the spell 
being cast. Higher proficiency in SPELL KNOWLEDGE will help a character 
decipher the unintelligible sounds and display the proper name of the 
spell being cast. This is extremely useful for understanding when an 
enemy is casting an offensive spell at you!
 
Characters who lack SPELL KNOWLEDGE, or whose proficiency check fails, 
may even misinterpret the words and think an entirely different spell is 
being cast - a friend might appear to be casting CHAIN LIGHTNING at you, 
or an enemy casting CURE LIGHT, for example.

SPELLBOOKS

Sorcerer-types, rangers, and bards need to write their spells down into 
their spellbooks in order to be able to use them. Spellbooks are for sale 
in shops dealing with magical items. To write a spell in a spellbook, the 
SCRIBE command must be used.

In order to memorize a spell you must have a spellbook in your inventory 
with the spell in question scribed into it. To SCRIBE a spell, find a 
master, typically your guild master, and rest. With a spellbook in one 
hand and a quill in another type SCRIBE. It will show what spells are in 
your spellbook. If you are just starting your book will be blank. 

Type SPELLS to see a list of spells you can SCRIBE into your book. SCRIBE
<spellname>. Your skill in SCRIBE dictates how many pages in your 
spellbook the spells you SCRIBE will take up and as a result how long it 
will take to SCRIBE your spells. 

Do not lose those books! If you part with them for any reason you will 
become a helpless weakling unable to cast your magic!

SPHERE

Spell spheres are skills for casting classes. They advance as any other
skill might, when a spell of that type is used. Spell potency is related

Duration       : Proficiency
Classes        : Berserker           Level 60
===============================================
 
SPIRIT OF THE BEAR is one of three berserker CHANTS. It imbues the  
berserker with the overwhelming strength of bear, increasing attack 
damage above and beyond the bonus from BERSERK trance. It also grants 
access to the GROUND SHAKER ability. Spirits can only be invoked while in 
a BERSERK trance.

Duration       : Proficiency
Classes        : Berserker           Level 25

SPLIT
 
Usage:   split <amount to split> <coin_type>
 
Example: split 1 platinum 4 gold 16 silver 40 copper
         split 1000 copper
         split 20 platinum 400 gold
 
SPLIT is used to split money among people in your group who are in the 
same room as you. Each person in the group receives their fair share of 
the money, and the remainder is randomly distributed. If you are in a 
group with 4 other people, all of whom are in the same room with you, and 
you split 101 copper, you will give each of the other 4 group members 20 
coins each. (100 coins is split 5 ways; you keep your share and give 
everyone else their share). The odd coin out is given to a randomly 
chosen group member in the room (it could be you, or it could be someone 
else.)  If someone is in your group but outside the room, they will miss 
out on their share.

SPRINGLEAP "SPRING LEAP"
 
================================================
Usage      : springleap <victim>
Aggressive : yes
Classes    : Monk           Level 50
================================================
 
With proper training in martial arts, skilled monks learn to channel 
their muscle power into their legs, and leap from a sitting or resting 
position into their opponent, potentially knocking the victim over for a 
short amount of time, an effect similar to a BASH. Failure may result in 
the monk springing over the target or being knocked back.
 
Unlike BASH, SPRINGLEAP can be used without a shield. SPRINGLEAP can only 
initiate combat; it can not be used if you are already in combat like 
BASH or BACKSTAB.
 
SPRINGLEAP can only be used against mobs within one size category of 
yourself. Dragons cannot be knocked down by SPRINGLEAP.

Usage: stat [player | object | mobile | file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game. The 
type argument is optional.

   STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people
   with names such as Red or Cityguard.

   STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

   STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

   STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the

STEAL

================================================
Usage      : steal <item> <victim>
Aggressive : yes
Classes    : Thief         Level 1
================================================

Use STEAL to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced STEAL, and if the person
is asleep. If you are caught, the victim will become aggressive.

See also: PKILL, HIDE, SNEAK

STEALTH

Usage: sneak

Especially sneaky rogues and thieves learn how to cover up their tracks, 
making it difficult or impossible for would-be aggressors to track or 
locate them. When in STEALTH, users will also be invisible to 'who -z'. 
The STEALTH skill is initiated using the SNEAK command, and is only 
successful when SNEAK succeeds. The user will receive no indication on 
the specific success of the STEALTH skill, however.

"STONE SKIN"

============================================================
Usage         : cast 'stone skin' [<target>]
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : yes
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : support
Area of effect: target
Accumulative  : no
Duration      : 2 hours, 7 - 13 hits
Sphere        : protection
Fade message  : &3&dYour skin softens and returns to normal.&0
Classes       : Cryomancer     Circle 6
              : Necromancer    Circle 12
              : Pyromancer     Circle 6
              : Sorcerer       Circle 6
============================================================

STONE SKIN when cast upon a victim will greatly assist that persons fight
survivability. STONE SKIN will lessen the likelihood of that person being
hit during a battle, and if they are hit the damage is minimized. The 
spell is not perfect though and beings that are very powerful can strike 
through it on occasion.

STONE SKIN is not an armor-type spell and therefore can be combined with 
spells that increase your AC.

STOW

Usage: stow <item> <container>
       stow <item>

Drawing from their skill in concealing items, a thief may place an object 
in a container or the room, hiding the action from others in the room, 
even if they can see the thief. Only one item may be STOWED at a time. 
Upon failure, onlookers will become aware of the action and the attempt 
at subterfuge. Success depends on the user's skill in conceal, the item's 
weight, the user's Dexterity, and the item level versus the skill user's 
level.

STRENGTH CHAZ
 
Strength is the name of both an attribute, a spell, and an innate
ability. The help files for the spell and innate follow the attribute.
 
Strength is a measure of your raw muscle power. It determines the amount 
of weight you can carry and how heavy a weapon you can wield. On the 
battlefield, Strength plays even more important roles, helping to decide 
in melee combat whether you hit or miss (your to-hit) and how much damage 
you cause when you do hit.
 
Strength's effect on your to-hit chance is similar to hitroll or Wisdom, 
giving you an advantage when fighting similarly-leveled opponents, but 
greatly dwarfed by the effect of your level's THAC0. That means that no 
matter how much Strength and hitroll you have, you still won't be able to 
hit an enemy 25 levels above you.
 
The effect of Strength on the amount of damage you do can be more obvious 
than its effect on your to-hit. Every few points of Strength will 
translate into an extra point of damage per hit. This is actually the 
reason that stronger races such as barbarians and ogres do more 
damage--their true Strength values are much higher than the other races'.
 
 
STRENGTH SPELL
 
============================================================
Usage         : cast 'strength' [<target>]
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : support
Area of effect: target
Accumulative  : refresh
Duration      : 5 - 12 hours
Sphere        : enchantment
Fade message  : You feel weaker.
Classes       : Cryomancer     Circle 2
              : Necromancer    Circle 3
              : Pyromancer     Circle 2
              : Sorcerer       Circle 2
============================================================
 
Young mages learn very early on magical methods of enchanting more 
physical strength into themselves and others. This is probably done out 
of a life-long envy of the warrior types and their ease of attracting 
wenches with their muscular physiques.
 
 
CHAZ INNATE
 
============================================================
Usage         : innate chaz
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : no
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : support
Area of effect: target
Accumulative  : refresh
Duration      : 5 - 12 hours
Sphere        : enchantment
Fade message  : You feel weaker.
Races         : Orc            Innate
============================================================
 
Orcs have the ability to channel their violent spirits into their bodies, 
temporarily increasing their Strength scores.
 
This ability stacks (combines) with the Strength spell. It cannot be used 
to raise the Strength stat above 100.

depths of the demon plane itself. This will consume the foe of the 
diabolist inflicting great pain and suffering.

SUBCLASS_CLERIC SUBCLASS_PRIEST SUBCLASS_DIABOLIST SUBCLASS_DRUID

Clerics may choose one of the following subclasses, but they must do so 
by level 35 or remain a cleric. The questmasters for these subclasses are 
scattered across the realm, though they are generally found where one 
would expect.

Priest:         Clerics of good must triumph over the curses of evil. 
                Their subclass master can be found where there is purity 
                and clarity of thought.

Diabolist:      The wicked must fight with evil against good. Their 
                subclass master can be found among those who worship the 
                wicked deities in one of the more demonic centers of 
                worship in the realm.

Druid:          Clerics of the forests shall take on their skills and 
                spells from one who also is one with the forests, within 
                a similar, beautiful setting, deeply held within the high 
                forests where one might find a druid.

SUBCLASS_ROGUE SUBCLASS_ASSASSIN SUBCLASS_MERCENARY SUBCLASS_THIEF

Rogues may specialize into one of the following subclasses, provided they
do so by level 25. They must seek out the questmaster to do so. It is
rumored that this questmaster resides in a city of dwarves.

Assassin:       Those who wish to be trained killers may find their 
                subclass master up where such people are tolerated, but 
                failure could be costly.

Mercenary:      Thug-for-hire training can also be sought where such 
                activity is tolerated, and not where the good of the 
                realm wander.

Thief:          Thieves can learn to steal the same place assassins first 
                learn their killing arts. Some places tolerate those 
                activities better.

SUBCLASS_SORCERER SUBCLASS_CRYOMANCER SUBCLASS_PYROMANCER SUBCLASS_NECROMANCER

Sorcerers who wish to specialize may choose from the following 
subclasses. They must choose a specialty by level 45. There is a 
questmaster for each subclass located somewhere in the world, who must be 
found and obeyed by the sorcerer wishing to subclass.

Cryomancer:     Cryomancers, mages of cold and ice, can be trained by the 
                best in the realm. The master they must train under lives 
                where life is comfortably cold, and elevated in the air 
                by mighty land formation.
        
Illusionist:    Sorcerers throughout the ages have fought to prove 
                themselves the masters of the mystic arts. Illusionists 
                can be trained by one who has made himself a master of a 
                convoluted and twisting tower.

Necromancer:    The wicked must fight with evil against good. Their 
                subclass master can be found among those who worship the 
                wicked deities in one of the more demonic centers of 
                worship in the realm.

Pyromancer:     Pyromancers, mages of fire, can be trained in their 
                arcane arts by one who resides in a place where a mage of 
                fire would be nice and toasty without having to keep 
                himself so, probably below ground.

SUBCLASS_WARRIOR SUBCLASS_PALADIN SUBCLASS_ANTIPALADIN SUBCLASS_MONK SUBCLASS_RANGER

Warriors may choose from four subclasses. They must choose a subclass by
level 25 or remain a warrior forever. There is a questmaster for each
subclass, who must be sought out by the warrior who wishes to specialize.

Paladin:        Fighters of good must triumph over the curses of evil. 
                Their subclass master can be found where there is purity 
                and clarity of thought.

Antipaladin:    The wicked must fight with evil against good. Their 
                subclass master can be found among those who worship the 
                wicked deities in one of the more demonic centers of 
                worship in the realm.

Monks:          Monks, being one of mind and body, and strong and hard of 
                body as well, must find their subclass master in yet 
                another temple, this one neither strictly associated with 
                good or evil.

Ranger:         Fighters of the forests shall take on their skills and 
                spells from one of their kind within a similar, beautiful 
                setting, deeply held within the high forests where one 
                might find a ranger.

              : Priest         Circle 4
============================================================

SUMMON will teleport the target to your location. That is if they don't 
save against the spell and they are close enough to you. There is a quite 
nasty drawback that can happen on a failed summon. If you SUMMON a 
creature without permission from the creature they will more than likely 
attack you.

============================================================
 
A powerful spell, SUMMON CORPSE allows the caster to briefly touch upon
the cold powers of death and take a player's corpse from anywhere within
the same area and bring it to their feet. This can only be done with the
CONSENT of the person whose corpse is being summoned.

Effect        : summoning
Area of effect: room
Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : summoning
Classes       : none
============================================================

Conjurers, as their primary spell, can summon elementals from the 
different planes. The exact plane of summoning is imprecise so a variance 
of elementals is called upon to serve their magic master. Periodically 
though as a conjurer summons his minions one will arrive that is beyond 
the control of the master. When this happens it will attack the master 
and anyone else in the vicinity until such time that it dissipates and 
returns to its realm.

*In-game Quest Spell*

amount of fire energy from their body at once, burning all those 
unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity.

Tired of feeling like METEORSWARM just won't cut it anymore?  Are you 
filled with the fiery passion of a thousand suns?  Your sphere of fire 
underutilized at the highest levels of pyromantic power?  Then now, you 
can have hope. Ask your guildmaster if SUPERNOVA is right for you.

SVERFNEBLIN "Deep Gnome"
 
Sverfneblin, also known as deep gnomes, are the branch of the gnome race 
native to the Underdark, much as duergar are to dwarves. They spend 
their time almost exclusively in the rocky terrain of the Underdark, only 
leaving to cause mischief in the surface world. Their infernal nature 
makes them decidedly unpleasant, but gives them a strength of will and 
force of personality not often found among the evil races. Millenia of 
hiding in the Underdark has caused them to develop stone gray skin and 
pale, gaunt eyes. Their hair tends to be pure white but well cared for 
and neatly coiffed. Sverfneblin have a natural affinity for blending in 
with the rocks, giving them innate sneak capabilities among mountains, 
caves, and their native Underdark.
 
STATS:
Strength     : below average
Dexterity    : slightly above average
Intelligence : extremely above average
Wisdom       : highly above average
Constitution : slightly below average
Charisma     : slightly above average
 
INNATE BONUSES:
- Small size

SWITCH
 
================================================
Usage      : automatic
Aggressive : yes
Classes    : Anti-Paladin   Level 10

           : Ranger         Level 10
           : Warrior        Level 10
================================================
 
SWITCH is a skill automatically used when trying to change targets during 
combat. Your proficiency in switching will determine if you are able to 
attack another target while already fighting, or if you become confused 
by your attempt.
 
The SWITCH skill is used when you attempt to switch targets using 
HIT or KILL, as well as for some aggressive skills, including KICK or 
BASH.
 
See also: KICK, KILL, PARRY
#0
SYSLOG

Usage: syslog [ fine | info | debug | status | warning | error | critical ]

The SYSLOG command controls how severe of online system log messages you 
see. The syslog severity you select is the minimum severity of messages 
that will be reported to you. Fine is the least severe setting and 
critical is the most severe. For instance, setting your syslog to 
'warning' will cause you to see all warning, error, and critical 
messages. Messages surrounded by '[' and ']' are syslog messages and are 
in green if you have color on.

The messages you receive are level dependent.

Examples:

  > syslog status
  > syslog critical

================================================

Those who follow in the footsteps of nature and embody a closeness to
the animals of the realm can induce a calm that will make the animals
prone to patience and suggestion. Tamed mounts will rarely throw riders
of moderate skill.

TANTRUM
 
================================================
Usage      : tantrum
Aggressive : yes
Classes    : Berserker      Level 45
================================================
 
Similar to HITALL, the berserker TANTRUM lashes out at all surrounding  
targets. Tantrum always hits all valid opponents in the room--i.e., not 
just the ones fighting the user. Unlike HITALL, TANTRUM can cause the 
user to hit with both a weapon or barehand attack (i.e., monk BAREHAND). 
Like other berserker skills, TANTRUMS may only be thrown when BERSERKING.

              : Sorcerer       Circle 4
============================================================

Magic users up for adventure or in need of escape can invoke a power of
summoning to move themselves a short distance in any location. This will
prove to be a lifesaver or certain death as the location of the outcome 
is purely random in the current zone/area.

THAC0

THAC0 is an acronym for "To Hit Armor Class 0."  THAC0 is a number every 
player and monster has, and it is dependent on level and class. It is 
ranged between 0 and 20. THAC0 is the method that the MUD code uses to 
determine whether or not you have successfully "hit" an opponent while in 
battle. It is calculated for everyone fighting, for each and every combat 
round. For THAC0's, the lower the number you have, the better success you 
will have at hitting.

For example:  let's say your THAC0 is 10, meaning you have to roll 
between 10 and 20 on a 20-sided die in order to hit an enemy with an 
Armor Class of 0. If you are fighting a monster with an Armor Class of 1, 
then you need to roll between 11 and 20 to hit that mob. If the mob's 
Armor Class is 8, you only need to roll between 2 and 20 in order to hit 
that monster.  You can affect your THAC0 by using magical items that give 
a positive hitroll bonus. This bonus will enhance your THAC0 and 
therefore your ability to hit a monster.

THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to 
prevent a player from playing. If frozen, the game will ignore all 
commands entered by the player, including QUIT, until the player is 
unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

THIEF THIEVES
 
   Thieves are rogues who take special delight in relieving others of 
their precious belongings. Caring nothing for hard earned rewards, they 
take what they want when they want it. Having no real sense of morals, 
Thieves will resort to dirty tricks of all kinds when cornered in combat, 
and know where to stick their foes to do the most damage. Thieves are 
adept at the surreptitious manipulation of objects, and they tend to have 
an encyclopedic knowledge of the loot to be found across the realm.
 
   Thieves are adept at identifying objects through the IDENTIFY command, 
and can usually learn all they need without resorting to magic.

Primary Attributes:   Dexterity, Constitution
Allowed Races:        Dwarf, Duergar, Gnome, Half-elf, Halfling, Human,            
                      Orc, Sverfneblin

Experience to Level:  Average
  
     *Note:  Thief is a subclass of Rogue and, as with all other 
             subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain 
             degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.

THROATCUT "THROAT CUT"
 
================================================
Usage      : throatcut <victim>
Aggressive : yes
Classes    : Assassin       Level 30
================================================
 
Assassins that have gained sufficient experience in their deadly arts may 
put their stealth techniques to use in an attempt to strike at their
target. The assassin will attempt to sneak up behind their victim and 
slit their throat with their weapon. The weapon must be a one-handed
slashing weapon. Success is also influenced by the type of terrain, which
may provide more or less stealth for the assassin to launch their 
surprise attack.
 
Damage done is based on a percentage of the victims maximum HP and can do 
upwards of 99% although a penalty to exp gained accompanies this lethal 
strike.
 
Assassins may not use throat cut while already engaged in combat, or 
against a target who is already engaged in combat. They can only throat 
cut a mob within one size category of themselves. They cannot throat cut 
dragons under any circumstance.

TIME

Usage: time

Gives you the current game time. Your initial reaction to the output of 
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it. You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.

#0
TITLE

Usage: title
       title <number>

Throughout the course of your game, you may earn various titles to 
describe your achievements and status. The title command allows you
to view and switch between any of your earned titles.
 
The first "title" typically available to a player is a simple last
name. After reaching a suitable level of experience (level 20), a
player may request a deity to set their last name. The name must
be appropriate to class and race, and must otherwise conform to
the naming rules.

See also: DESC, FLAGS, WHO, NAME
#0
TOGGLE

Usage: toggle [<option>]

There are several on-off settings that affect miscellaneous aspects of 
gameplay. They are gathered under the TOGGLE command. When TOGGLE is 
entered alone, a list of toggles and their current settings is displayed. 
Enter TOGGLE <option> to flip a specific option on or off.

TROLL TROLLS "SWAMP TROLLS"
 
Horrid carnivores, swamp trolls make their lairs around dense and murky
bog waters. Though their frame appears thin and frail, they possess 
surprising strength in their long and ungainly arms. The troll's rubbery,  
moss green to putrid gray hide blends well with their natural habitat. 
Preying on all but the most powerful of creatures, swamp trolls know no 
fear and attack unceasingly with their sharp claws and jagged bite.
 
Trolls have a reduced skill cap on DODGE and PARRY skills due to their size. 
 
STATS:
Strength     : above average
Dexterity    : average
Intelligence : bad
Wisdom       : bad
Constitution : Unparalleled
Charisma     : below average

TROPHY

Since killing the same mob over and over can get really dull and a lot 
simpler as we get used to it, you get less experience if you repeatedly 
kill the same mob. The number of times you have killed a certain mob can 
be viewed by the command TROPHY. 

You will get experience for the first few; however, this will decrease 
after a number of kills.

However the TROPHY list is a fixed length (currently).
<>:<> trophy
 
Your Trophy List Is:

Kills       Mobiles
  2.00     the familiar
  1.00     the cute rabbit
  2.00     the fallow deer
  1.00     the brown fox
  4.00     the Large Worm
  8.00     the Lesser Shade
  4.00     the Large Shade
  6.00     the Skeleton
  0.33     the evil high priest
  2.33     the Larva Worm
  0.67     the Larva Worm
  3.00     a small iguana
  3.00     the fire ant
  1.00     the majestic praying mantis

  7.00     the small green beetle
  1.00     the huge black spider
  1.00     the army ant

In this example the player has visited several newbie areas about 
Mielikki. There is an army ant at the bottom of this players list. If 
this player decides to assist something else other than on this list meet 
its doom then the army ant will scroll off the bottom and the player will 
get full exp the next time he squashes an ant. The ant will also appear 
at the top of the list.

Much like the infravision spell of the surface dwelling races, 
ultravision is an innate effect unique to those races that dwell in the 
Underdark. It greatly increases aids their vision in the absence of 
light, essentially allowing them to see in the dark, but may interfere 
with the ability to see in lighted conditions, especially in sunlight.

============================================================
 

Those who fight for the side of night can eventually be granted a very 
powerful unholy power to speak a single word that good beings take such 
offense to that it will actually cause them significant damage. Those 
good beings who react to this righteous word in a particularly poor 
manner have a chance to actually go blind or become paralyzed. This spell 
resembles dispel good with an area effect nature.

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Usage: use <staff>
       use <wand> <Target>

USING wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a 
character or an object.

USING a staff will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a 
room, except yourself. Therefore staves are naturally very powerful, and 
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Both staves and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to USE!  (Use the 
GRAB or HOLD commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

USERS gives a list of all sockets (i.e., connections) currently active on 
the MUD. The multi-column display shows the socket number (used by DC), 
class, level, and name of the player connected, connection state, idle 
time, and hostname.

The following switches are available:

-p         Show only sockets in the playing sockets.
-d         Show only non-playing (deadweight) sockets.

"VAMPIRIC TOUCH" "VAMPYRIC TOUCH"
 
================================================
Usage      : involuntary
Aggressive : N/A
Classes    : Anti-Paladin      Level 45
================================================

VAMPIRIC TOUCH is used by the anti-paladin to suck the very life-essence
out of his foes. In order to successfully use VAMPIRIC TOUCH, the 
anti-paladin must engage in direct physical combat with his enemy. This 
means that if either fighter is using a weapon, VAMPIRIC TOUCH will fail.
 
VAMPIRIC TOUCH has also been known to work in tandem with the 
anti-paladin's damage spells, though this is not always successful. 
VAMPIRIC TOUCH stacks with LAYHANDS.

Classes       : none
============================================================

Only the most skilled Cryomancers can use this spell to vaporize their 
own bodies into magically-bound clouds of gas. In this state, they become
extremely difficult to hit, as many attacks simply pass through their
bodies. Vaporform is a high-level quest spell, and as such may only be
attained via a deity quest.

VITEM

Usage: vitem <type> [<field> <query>] [[from] <start vnum> [to] <end vnum>]]
 
List items of the given type. The field, query, and vnum range parameters
work exactly like vsearch. This allows you an extra degree of control 
over plain osearch when searching for objects. Type vitem without 
parameters for a list of object types.
 
> vitem light
(get a list of all lights in the game)
 
> vitem potion level gt 50
(show potions above level 50)
 
> vitem weapon weight bt 5 and 10 from 30
(show weapons that weigh between 5 and 10 pounds from Mielikki)
 
> vitem scroll casts 'word of recall'
(list scrolls that cast word of recall)
 
> vitem scroll fillingness 5
(gives you an error because scrolls are not edible)

VLIST OLIST MLIST RLIST SLIST TLIST
 
Usage: olist
       olist <zone vnum>
       olist [from] <beginning vnum> [to] <end vnum>
       olist *
 
These commands all work the same. They will give you a list of objects, 
mobiles, rooms, shops, or triggers. The default is to give you a list of
such items in the zone that you're currently in. If you provide a single 
number, it's taken as a zone, and all items in that zone are listed. Two 
numbers will get you a list of all items between them (inclusive).

OLIST * will get you a list of every object prototype in the game. This 
is not generally recommended, except perhaps with shops.
 
The olist, mlist, rlist, and tlist commands are actually convenience 
aliases for the vlist command. Typing OLIST has the exact same effect 
as VLIST OBJ.
 
Examples:
   > mlist 0 200
   (display all mobile prototypes with vnums from 0 to 200)
 
   > tlist 30
   (display all triggers in zone 30)
 
   > olist
   (display all object prototypes in the current zone)
 
   > slist *
   (display all shops in the game)

VNUM MNUM ONUM RNUM SNUM TNUM ZNUM
 
Usage: vnum <type> <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       mnum <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       onum <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       rnum <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       snum <name>
       tnum <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       znum <name>
  
Identify items by name. These commands can be used to find mobiles, 
objects, rooms, shops, triggers, or zones whose names contain specific 
word.
 
For example:
 
> onum sword
(a list of objects called "sword" is shown)

> znum sea
(zones with the word sea in their title are listed)
 
The mnum, onum, rnum, and tnum commands all use the vnum command 
structure, which allows an optional set of parameters at the end of the 
command to restrict your search to a certain block of vnums, or a 
specific zone. (The words "to" and "from" are optional.)
 
> onum bottle 30
(show bottles from Mielikki)
 
> rnum Beggar's from 6000 to 6299
(show rooms with vnums between 6000 and 6299 with "Beggar's" in the 
title)

VSEARCH MSEARCH OSEARCH RSEARCH SSEARCH TSEARCH VFIND MFIND OFIND RFIND SFIND TFIND
 
Usage: vsearch <type> <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       vfind <type> <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       msearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       osearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       rsearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       ssearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       tsearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
 
These commands will display entities of a given type based on a search 
query. These entities may be one of five types: mobiles, objects, rooms, 
shops, and triggers. The field parameter determines the aspect you are 
searching on, for instance "name" or "cost". Each of the five types have 
different fields available, listed below. The query parameter describes 
the search to be conducted. This query could be a single word, for name 
searches, or a number range, for cost searches. The last set of 
parameters is optional, and allows you to restrict your search to a 
certain block of vnums, or a specific zone. The word "to" is always 
optional, and "from" is sometimes optional. (Under certain circumstances 
if "from" is omitted, vsearch will think the start vnum is part of the 
search query.)
 
Each search type has a list of possible fields to search on, and each 
field belongs to a "domain"--a loosely-defined set of possible values for 
the query parameter. For instance, mobile hitpoints belong to the number 
domain: they could be "45" or "32000", but never "sword". While you do 
not actually need to know about domains to use the vsearch command, 
knowledge of each domain's allowed values will be useful in building 
proper vsearch queries. See the VSEARCH DOMAINS help file for more 
information.
 
Following is a list of possible search fields for each entity type.
 
MOBILE:  name/alias, short (desc), long (desc), desc, species/race, size,
         sex/gender, level, class, alignment, hitpoints/hp, movement/mv,
         hitroll/hr, damroll/dr, damage/averagedamage, damdice/damnodice,
         sizedamdie/damsizedice, armor/ac, platinum, gold, silver, copper,
         perception, hiddenness, position, defaultposition, triggervnum,
         actflags, affflags
OBJECT:  name/alias, shortdesc, longdesc, actiondesc/adesc, type,
         extraflags/bits, wear/worn, weight, cost, rent/costperday, 
         timer, level, hiddenness, apply, extradescs, limitation, 
         spellflags/affflags, triggervnum, lasts, casts, chargesinitial, 
         chargesremaining, damnodice, damsizedice, attacktype, average,

         platinum, gold, silver, copper, targetroom, entrymessage, 
         charmessage, exitmessage, direction, crumbles, hitpoints/hp
ROOM:    name/title, sector, description, exit, extra, flags, triggervnum
SHOP:    name, keeper, bits, tradeswith, room, mobile, open1, open2, 
         close1, close2, sells, buys
TRIGGER: name, type, argument, numbericarg/numericarg, commands, 
         intention

"VSEARCH DOMAINS" VSEARCH_DOMAINS
 
Vsearch supports eight hard-coded field domains. Each one allows you to
construct a query in a different way. Although you are not required to 
understand vsearch domains, knowledge of them will enable you to write 
more powerful vsearch queries.
 
&8NUMBER&0

The number domain basically lets you supply a number as a search query
parameter. However, it also allows you to enter ranges. For the search
fields in the number domain, the following query syntaxes are supported:
 
    [equals | is] <number>
    {ne | not} <number>
    gt <number>
    lt <number>
    ge <number>
    le <number>
    {between | bt} <lower bound> [and] <upper bound>
    zone <zone number>
 
Supplying just a number is the same as explicitly specifying "equals",
which returns entities where the field has the exact value of the search
query. Specifying a query such as "gt" though, will return all entities 
with a field value greater than the one given in the search query. 

For example:
 
    vsearch mobile hitpoints gt 500
 
will give you all mobiles with (average) hitpoints greater than 500. The
"between" query lets you specify two bounds, and return all entities 
between those two. The "zone" query type is designed to be used with 
number fields like room exit (but can be used with any number field). It 
allows you to specify a zone number, and a between query will 
automatically be generated with the lower and upper bounds as the bottom 
and top vnums for that zone.
 
&8STRING&0
 
The string domain actually just takes a single word for the search query.
Any following words will probably be ignored.
 
&8TYPE&0
 
This search query domain refers to fields where there are a preset list 
of possible string values, such as class or gender. Only one word of the
search query is interpreted as the type string. Attempting to specify an
invalid type will result in an error; for example, trying to search for
mobiles of class "foobar" won't work. Abbreviations of types are allowed.
 
&8FLAGS&0
 
This search query domain allows searching on bitfields, like spell or mob
flags. You can specify a list of as many flags as you want, but they must
all be valid flags, or an error will be thrown. For example, to find all
mobiles who have perma haste, blur, and stone skin, you would type:
 
    vsearch mobile aff haste blur stone
 
The list will be terminated if it encounters the word "from", which is 
used to signify the start of vnum bound parameters.
 
&8SPELL&0
 
This search query domain requires you to enter a valid spell name (skill
and chant names are also accepted). The spell name can optionall be
enclosed in single quotes, unless it is a multi-word spell (such as word 
of recall), in which case the quotes are required. This search domain is 
used by fields such as "casts":
 
    vsearch object casts 'word of recall'
 
would return all wands, scrolls, staves, and potions that cast word of
recall.
 
&8APPLY&0
 
The apply domain lets you enter an apply type (like Strength, hit regen, 
or damroll) followed by an optional numerical comparison, interpreted 
following the number domain rules. The following are all valid queries:
 
    vsearch object apply strength
    osearch apply hp ge 50
    osearch apply dr lt 0
 
The first query returns objects with any sort of strength apply, the 
second returns objects with +50hp or more, and the third returns all 
objects with-dr applies. Only the 'object apply' field uses this domain.
 
&8TRIGGER TYPE&0
 
This is a special two-part type domain. The first word is either mobile,
object, or room and the second is a list of trigger types (enter, greet,
etc.) This lets you find, for example, all mobile triggers that are 
flagged both GREET and RANDOM:
 
    vsearch trigger type mobile greet random
 
Only the 'trigger type' field uses this domain.
 
&8BOOLEAN&0
 
This domain accepts either a 'yes' or a 'no' value (though some other
equivalent values such as 'true' and 'false' are also accepted). This 
domain is used by fields like 'object poisoned'.

#100
VSTAT

Usage: vstat < mob | obj > <virtual number>

Used to stat a prototypical mobile or object by virtual number.

Examples:

  > vstat obj 3000
  > vstat mob 3001

See also: LOAD, STAT, VNUM
#100
VWEAR
 
Usage: vwear <position> [<field> <query>] [[from] <start vnum> [to] <end vnum>]]
 
List items that can be worn in the given position. The field, query, and 
vnum range parameters work exactly like vsearch. This allows you an extra 
degree of control over plain osearch when searching for objects. Type 
vwear without parameters for a list of object types.
 
> vwear head
(get a list of all headgear in the game)
 
> vwear 2hwield level gt 50
(show 2-hand wieldable items level 50 or above)
 
> vwear hold capacity between 10 and 20 from 30
(show containers, liquid containers, and fountains with capacities between
 10 and 20 units from Mielikki)

#100
WAKE SLEEPING REST SIT STAND

For changing your position. If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea 
to SIT and REST for a while, or maybe even take a nap.

Note that you can engage in combat from most any position. You can SIT 
and fight if you so choose and the game does not force you to STAND. You 
must manually type STAND if that is your desire.

REST allows you to recover hit points and movement points more rapidly. 
SLEEP has the highest regeneration rate, but leaves you deaf and blind to 
the world around you. Being attacked in either position increases the 
damage dealt to you.

WARRIOR
 
   Warriors are skilled in many areas of combat, but excel in none and 
have no special bonuses. Some warriors have been known to forget 
specializing in any one area of their craft and after learning all they 
can, go on to learn an entirely different profession.
 
   Basic warriors do not cast spells and require no additional 
preparation after starting play and are highly survivable. For that 
reason, they make ideal characters for first time players. Most warrior 
subclasses do use magic, creating a wide range of play styles.
 
Primary Attributes:   Strength, Constitution
Allowed Races:        Barbarian, Dragonborn (all), Duergar, Dwarf,
                      Half-Elf, Halfling, Human, Ogre, Orc, Troll

WISDOM TASS
 
The Wisdom attribute largely affects usage of skills. Whether or not your 
proficiency in a skill improves when you use it is decided solely and 
equally by your Wisdom and Intelligence attributes. The Wisdom attribute 
also affects your chance of success in various skills and spells, namely 
conceal (and palm/stow) and animate dead.
 
Wisdom also has some influence in combat, helping determine whether you 
hit an enemy in melee combat, but not to as great an extent as Strength 
and hitroll.
 
Wisdom affects spell saves, with an effect per point approximately 
equivalent to the effect of a level. For example, gaining 10 levels would 
make you more difficult to hit with a spell. Raising your Wisdom by 10 
points would have the same effect.

 *In-game quest spell*
Using a magically-enhanced suggestion, a caster of this spell can place a

single word.

"WORD OF RECALL" RECALL "SCROLL OF RECALL"

WORD OF RECALL spell
 
============================================================
Usage         : cast 'word of recall' [<self>]
Min. position : standing
OK in combat  : yes
Aggressive    : no
Effect        : transit
Area of effect: realm
Duration      : instantaneous
Sphere        : summoning
Classes       : Cleric         Circle 3
              : Diabolist      Circle 4
              : Druid          Circle 4
              : Priest         Circle 4
============================================================

The caster will be transferred back to their hometown or clanhall if they 
are in a clan. WORD OF RECALL does not go off instantly after 
successfully casting it. If the caster leaves the room where the spell 
was cast before it teleports them, the spell fails completely. This means 
casting it in combat can be risky! Be sure you can survive a round or two 
before the recall activates! This spell only works on the caster.

SCROLL OF RECALL item

   Usage: recite recall [<target>]

SCROLLS OF RECALL exist in four different colors - green, red, blue, and 
gray. When RECITED, the scroll teleports the target to their guildmaster 
in the city associated with the color of the scroll. Carrying a set of 
these scrolls is an extremely handy way to return to a town and get to an 
inn quickly. They can also be used in combat, but like WORD OF RECALL, 
the spell does not activate instantaneously! If the target leaves the 
room where the scroll was used before they are recalled, the recall will 
fail and the scroll will still be lost!

============================================================

Magic users up for adventure or in need of escape can invoke a power of 
summoning to move themselves a great distance in any location. This will 
prove to be a lifesaver or certain death as the location of the outcome 
is purely random, and can be anywhere in the entire game.

  hand skills beyond their starting repertoire have several opportunities

  the city.

history. The only known place with history predating the Rift Wars, the 
construction of the Barrow dates back over 2000 years. It serves as the 
resting place of several kings of old, many of whose names are only 
whispers in history. It hosts a coven of insidious witches seeking to 
learn from a master beyond life. It is the lair of two abominable 
dragons. But perhaps the Barrow is perhaps most well-known for its death 
pits of monstrous rats.

Points of Interest:
- Powerful holy swords have been laid to rest among the dead here.
- A legendary potion is brewed by the coven of Barrow witches.
- The ring of a king is said to transform a person's very form to 
  something more durable yet chilling.

northern shores from the Arabel Ocean for the first time. The Dancing 
Dolphin Inn stands in the eastern part of the Beachhead, the Wailing 
Mountains rising up to the south.

Description:
The South Caelia Beachhead boasts warm sandy dunes and a prominent 
lighthouse guides sailors safely to its shores. Some dangerous ocean life 
inhabits the waters just off shore, but the land is a common place for 
healers and sailors to spend their time.

Points of Interest:
- Marigolds grow wild in this place, which healers use for poultices.
- The warm sands are ideal places for dragons to nest.

Level: 18 to 25

Location:
The Black Ice Desert may or may not be located on Ethilien at all! It is 
only accessible through a mysterious portal in the western part of North 
Caelia. The desolation may or may not be related to the fall and 
desecration of the Laveryn Labyrinth on the south end of the desert.

come here. They seem healthy enough, as does the wildlife in the nearby 
Kaas Plains.

Points of Interest:
- Some come to learn unholy secrets which burble up from the pitch black 
  of the lake's untold depths from time to time.

Location:
The Blue-Fog Trail extends immediately past the south gate of Village of 
Mielikki, leading to the Mountain of Mist.

Description:
Immediately beyond the safety of Mielikki's south gate stretches the 
eerie Blue-Fog Trail. At one time a major trading route between Mielikki 
and the towns beyond, the trail is now socked in by the eponymous 
Blue-Fog, opening the way to terrors from beyond the mists.

A few brave merchants still traverse the trail, but adventurers regularly 
meet their ends in the clutches of mist and water elementals and 
monstrous other-worldly beings. Fortunately, a watchman at the southern 
gate prevents anyone under level 30 from leaving the city via the 
Blue-Fog Trail.

This sinister monument to death and darkness stands west off the Black 
Rock Trail near the City of Anduin.

Description:
The Cathedral of Betrayal is the central hub of necromancer, diabolist, 
and anti-paladin activity in Caelia. It consists of two primary areas: 
the outdoor grounds and the indoor sanctum. The outer grounds are safer 
for lower level adventurers; the inner areas are guarded by blind 
priestesses who will bring swift and horrific death to any but the most 
powerful of heroes. The Cathedral is locked in a constant war with the 
Abbey of St. George, far to the south.

Village of Mielikki, between the Light Forest and the Enchanted Hollow.

Description:
The Citadel of Testing is a proving ground for new Sorcerers to test 
their ingenuity and arcane prowess. The Citadel is occupied by powerful 
magicians and sorcerers, all in service to the Grand Master. Shifting 
passages and changing walls make navigating the Citadel tricky, but the 
mystic rewards inside can be well worth the effort.

arduous, though necessary if trying to leave the Arctic Village of Ickle
for either the City of Anduin or the Village of Mielikki on foot. The 
vast frozen fields are home to a variety of tundra animals, but food and 
water are scarce. Travelers would do well to secure provisions before

North of the Black Forest and south of the Cold Fields along the Nikozian 
Trail. The route through the Dark Mountains also marks the northern 
access point for the Iron Hills.

"AREA_DEMISE KEEP" "DEMISE KEEP"
Level: 60 to 80

Location:
The imposing visage of Demise Keep rises up over the south end of the
Syric Mountain Trail off the Black Rock Trail far to the west of the 
Village of Mielikki.

Description:
Surrounded by evil trees, the deathly and violent nature of Demise Keep 
is immediately obvious to all nearby. Wretched warriors guard the keep, 
where enormous metal skeletons, more machine than bone, roam the lower 
levels. Hideous soul-drinking monsters loom in droves around the sinister 
halls, in service to a terrifying master. Tormented by these dark forces, 
a young imprisoned mage and his apprentices hold on to the last vestiges 
of their sanity.

Points of Interest:
- A silly game turned deadly has the potential for great rewards, should 
  a servant of divinity be amongst your number.

"AREA_SEVERANS DOOM" SEVERAN DOOM AREA_DOOM AREA_SEVERAN              
Level: 90 to 99

Location:
An ancient pyramid deep in the Black Woods leads to a mythic history
spanning the planes themselves.

Description:
Here begins the sad saga of the hero Severan, his love Irinia, and 
Lokari, God of the Moonless Night. Long ago, Lokari looked down on
Ethilien from his Keep in the Outer Planes. His gaze settled upon the
beautiful Irinia, a loving, compassionate woman who inspired the best in 
people. Awe-struck by her radiant soul, the nefarious Lokari vowed 
to make Irinia his. Only problem was, she was already betrothed to the 
great hero Severan. Undeterred, Lokari violated the cosmic order, 
kidnapped Irinia and took her to his Keep beyond the material plane 
preparing her for a forced wedding. Severan rallied his mightiest allies 
to his call, swearing to rescue Irinia and punish Lokari. Lokari's sister 
Azkrael, Goddess of the Hunt, and her divine allies Rhalean, Goddess of 
Justice, and Timun, God of the Sun, empowered Severan and his crusade, 
guiding them to Lokari's planar Keep to enact divine retribution on the 
Moonless God.
 
The plan failed.
 
Lokari slaughtered every last one of them, from Severan to his own 
sister, imprisoning their souls and turning them into his immortal 
playthings. Now, the Oracles of the three gods see the time for true 
justice has come. They await an army of heroes like Severan and his 
comrades to rise up and dethrone the God of the Moonless Night. These 
heroes will be tested on the material plane, before battling through the 
Elemental Planes of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, and ultimately laying 
siege to Lokari's Keep itself.
 
Points of Interest:
- Lokari presents a threat greater than Ethilien can contain. 5 - 8 
  heroes are needed to stand a chance in this off-world crusade against 
  the God of the Moonless night.
- Where there is cosmic risk, there is cosmic reward.

"AREA_DROW CITY OF DHEDUU" "CITY OF DHEDUU" DHEDUU "DROW CITY OF DHEDUU"
 
Level: 45 to 60

Location:
The City of Dheduu exists deep in the bowels of Ethilien, but can be 
accessed through a portal in the Misty Caverns east of the Village of 
Mielikki.

Description:
Dheduu is a metropolis of dark elves who relish trafficking slaves from 
the upper world. It had some access to the evil races, prolific there but 
unseen elsewhere in Caelia. It probably exists somewhere deep beneath the 
evil continent. The main connection with the outside world and other 
underground areas was a cavern tunnel on the north end of the city; 
however, a recent cave-in blocked this off and the drow have been 
hard-pressed to stabilize their lifestyle since then. A nearby cave 
filled with edible fungus and domesticated, cow-like creatures with six 
legs leaves them with enough food... barely.

Desperate enough to blast their way through solid rock to find a way out, 
the drow of House Z'kenian took the end of the drider tunnel and made a 
portal to as close as they could get to Mielikki, which they knew about 
from torturing the elven prisoner in their care. Though a large city such 
as Templace would, they felt, be too dangerous (not knowing about its 
fall), a small forest village seemed like the perfect place to plunder 
for slaves and loot...
 
The city is divided between several prominent Houses, each of whom rules 
their own specific domain of influence amongst the Underdark's citizens. 
At the head of the city is famed House Kar'Shezden, primary priestesses 
to the demon spider-goddess Lolth.

Points of Interest:
- Long have the warriors of Dheduu taken captives from the surface world. 
  Once such captive has been there for quite some time and may provide a 
  unique opportunity for would-be liberators.
- High Priestess Vilekka Kar'Shezden is willing to hear supplications 
  from those wishing to curry favor with her goddess Lolth. However, only 
  the most experienced will be able to satisfy her greatest demands.

"AREA_ENCHANTED VILLAGE OF NORDUS" NORDUS "ENCHANTED VILLAGE OF NORDUS" AREA_NORDUS
Level: 45 to 60

Location:
The Enchanted Village of Nordus is lost somewhere in the Northern Swamp.

Description:
Nordus was a town of mages, prosperous despite its remote location, until
a mysterious madness began to infect the town. A newcomer arrived and 
persuaded the Nordus town council to turn their problems over to him, as 
he proposed a cure for the madness. One, however, remained suspicious of 
the newcomer as the madness began to spread and, together with the 
pawnbroker, devised a means to escape from Nordus before it was too late.
The pawnbroker's final act of rebellion as the town was falling under the 
invader's control was to seal the path to his new lab by setting a coded 
phrase that periodically changed over the entrance to the tunnels. Now 
the town is completely subsumed by madness and mutation.

Points of Interest:
- The power of words and codes is not to be underestimated.

offers some challenging introductory puzzles that can't be solved by 
violence. The hollow also provides excellent hunting grounds for evil 
characters.

Points of Interest:
- The fey here keep many secrets. Watch them closely for hints on what to 
  do!
- The paths between the mists and fog can be very difficult to navigate 
  without talking to a few of the denizens of this place.

  it's tough!

human Jungle and Bone Tribes, and the dwarf-cousin Mountain Tribe, all of 
which she controls through terror and bloodshed. The people are in 
desperate need of heroes to overthrow the tyrant and help restore the 
natural order of the island.

Points of Interest:
- Any over level 55 who challenges the demigoddess will find themselves 
  in the midst of legend brought to life in a tale of matricide, deadly 
  love, and burning loss.
- A powerful pyromancer likes to set up on the volcano's side and pelt 
  seagulls with flaming rocks for target practice. He's crazy, but he 
  knows a lot.

Location:
The Fortress of Mystwatch stands just a bit north of the Village of 
Mielikki off the Old Road by way of the Great Road. It stands as one of

exit into the mangrove swamp around Split Skull can provide a quick 
escape from Mystwatch as well.

Description:

sorcerer-general. Many of the undead forces are incorporeal and cannot be 
affected without divine blessings. Demon lords are said to exert control 
over Mystwatch as well, but they are well hidden.

  recruiting soldiers to expel the evil from the Fortress.
- Even the darkest night cannot protect the living from the life-hungry 
  eyes of the undead.
- The most powerful Anti-Paladins may find their greatest experiences

Location:
Frost Valley is hidden past Mount Frostbite out east of the Arctic 
Village of Ickle.

Description:
Frost Valley consists of two main areas: the eastern Frost Lake,

voracious winter beasts, but the plateau is also home to violent frost 
giants and barbaric verbeegs who will not hesitate to murder interlopers.

Two primary structures stand out against the bleak wintry landscape:
a trapper's lodge in the north-east corner, and a fortified keep in 
the south-west corner above the plateau. At the far north end of the 
plateau stands a crag split open by an ancient catastrophe known as the 
"Time Cataclysm." Frost elves can be found here in large numbers, one of 
the only places in all of Caelia this is still true.

Points of Interest:
- The elves often carry extremely rare canoes that weigh almost nothing a 
  valuable commodity for any explorer.
- An unfortunate warmage has been waylaid in the valley in his search for 
  greater protective magics. Sorcerer-types may be able to glean some 
  clues from his work.
- The remnants of the Time Cataclysm hold a fanciful key to a time long 
  forgotten, if only it can shake up its home.

Level: 55 to 65

Location:
This island of druids and great beasts rises up in the southwestern 
Arabel Ocean, north and west of the Beachhead of South Caelia.

Description:
Griffin Isle is a strange land where the tenuous fate of nature in the 
face of otherworldly corruption hangs in the balance. It is named for the 
ferocious winged beasts that populate the island, beasts worshiped by an 
insidious cult. Battling the cult's influence is a powerful enclave of 
druids, but without assistance they will surely lose. Caught between 
these two forces are a colorful cast of local residents, each with their 
own reason for being on the isle.

Points of Interest:
- The druids of Griffin Isle desperately need to recover certain ancient 
  implements to strike down the cult of the griffin god.

Mielikki just inside the south gate.

Description:
True to its name this house is haunted by ghosts and spirits. It is also 
home to a sizable gremlin population who fit in perfectly with the creepy 
crawlies of the house. If you've ever wanted to fight the skeletons in 
someone else's closet, this is the place for you! It's an ideal hunting 
ground for good-aligned aspiring heroes.

Points of Interest:
- Several of the items here are great for outfitting a starting 
  adventurer, particularly those in need of new boots.
- As one might expect, several of the monsters here are incorporeal, 
  meaning they can only be damaged if you are blessed by the gods. 
  Fortunately, one of the few known consumable sources of blessings can 
  be found here in decent number!
- This house is probably so haunted because it is home to a hidden 
  Necromancer Guild hall. Be sure to use the SEARCH command to 
  locate the house's secrets!

north of the Black Woods and south of the Dark Mountains. The western 
part of the plains is dominated by the Black Lake. It also connects to 
the southern steppes of the Iron Hills.

good folk, since the nearby elven city of Templace lies in evil-infested 
ruins. An array of wildlife runs free across the plains, including 
buffalo, gophers, and wolves.

"AREA_KING OF DREAMS" "REALM OF THE KING OF DREAMS" "KING OF DREAMS" KOD
Level: 80 to 95

Location:
The far north end of the Syric Mountain Trail leads directly to this area 
of reality suffused with the power of the Dreaming.

Description:
Many centuries ago, an inter-planar incursion fused the wilds of the 
Dreaming with the material plane, resulting in this realm of 
legends-made-flesh. From the dreams of humans across the multiverse these 
mythological figures and folklore tales birthed their way into Ethilien. 
There are several storylines running through the area, based around the  
King's Son, the Goblin King, and the Swan Princess, but they're hardly 
the only stories layered through the area. Even Queen Mab makes an 
appearance.

Points of Interest:
- Some of the most potent treasures in Ethilien can be found in this 
  realm.

"AREA_TEMPLACE" TEMPLACE
Level: 85 to 99

Location:
The desecrated ruins of Templace stand on the western shores of Black 
Lake.

Description:
Some thousand years ago, chaos erupted as the once-proud elven city of 
Templace was plunged into war. Now only rubble remains of what once was.
Legend has it that the infernal god Blackmourne with the help of his high 
priest Ruin Wormheart tore open the fabric of the planes and allowed 
demons to invade, led by the hellish dragon Sagece of Raymif and her 
infernal brood.

Moreover, the spiteful god killed the mortal priest of his brother-god 
Metamorpho, Giir'Kaaz. Infuriated, Metamorpho stepped in and set matters 
aright - the infamous god was destroyed and the priest's body reclaimed.
The Kaazian priest's brother Ne'Kaaz, a sorcerer, and his sister 
Elia'Kaaz, a warrior, scattered to their own destinations after the war 
fading from record.

Templace was destroyed, and the Anti-Paladins created in the battle 
retreated to other regions, founding the City of Anduin. However, the 
fell dragon Sagece remained and turned the smoldering ruins into her 
throne.

Points of Interest:
- Sagece and her servitors guard a number of fantastical treasures, many 
  of which can only be liberated after she is slain.
- The three legendary heroes of the Kaaz clan were barely enough to end 
  the Rift Wars. It would be foolish to assume Sagece could be toppled by 
  anything less.

exponentially more dangerous creatures stalk the tunnels. At one end of 
the tunnels sits a temple dedicated to the destructive forces of Fire.

burning death awaits the unprepared.

  treasures in its possession.

Location:
The labyrinthian remains of the Layveran Kingdom rest at the south end of 
the Black Ice Desert.

Description:
Long ago the thriving kingdom of Layveran was a shining beacon of hope.
Over time, the royal family succumbed to the worst aspects of human 
nature and ultimately descended into savage brutality. Now, the only 
vestige of this once-great land are the desecrated remains of the main 
palace. Profane demons and defiled angels dredge up weapons of pure 
darkness, leaving human souls to rot in their wake.

Points of Interest:
- Shadows made tangible and chaos tempered sharp, each held by an 
  indomitable beast, are an assassin and anti-paladin's best friends.

deadly!

An expansive array of services are available, from shops of all varieties 
to skill trainers to item update/repair craftsmen. All four base classes 
have their home Guilds here. Many subclasses have Guilds here as well.
The Grey Castle in south-west Mielikki is the location of the only 
Paladin and Monk Guild halls in all of Ethilien.

Location:
This unusual mine is dug under the Black Woods northeast of the City of 
Anduin.

Description:
The Minithawkin Mines, long ago sealed by a cave-in, were the only known 
source of the highly magical mineral thawkinixa. Mined in large 
quantities by dwarves, thawkinixa could be somehow drained and turned 
into items of wondrous power. Unfortunately, the cave-in cut off the mine 
entirely and everyone inside was assumed lost for good. However, the 
occasional opening lets daring spelunkers down into the depths to uncover 
what truly happened.

  nightmare tunnels protecting whatever is at the heart of this place.

who have set up permanent shops and businesses to serve the military 
personnel and any adventurers who find their way to town.

Although the residents tend toward evil, the Encampment relies on the 
rule of law and is regularly patrolled, so fighting in the streets is
heavily discouraged for visitors and residents alike.

It is safe for Ethilien's good races to visit and trade in Ogakh.

and the Dancing Dolphin Inn, the Sacred Haven, the Encampment of Ogakh, 
Bluebonnet Pass, the Sacred Megalith, and Dargentan's Lair.

Description:
Not nearly as expansive as its northern cousin, South Caelia is home to 
diverse wildlife and developing civilization nevertheless. Most 
adventurers make landfall at the Beachhead at the northern point of the 
subcontinent, then work their way through the Wailing Mountains and into 
the forested inlands. The Wailing Mountains are home to enormous Rocs, 
while the western Fangorn Forest shelters numerous spiders and sprites.
The eastern highlands around Lake Fedis are frequent hunting grounds for 
bandits and thieves, and the camping ground for a gypsy caravan. South 
holds Anlun Vale, a series of sacred sites occupied by druids and dryads. 
In the center stands a small outpost town, the Borderhold, where 
explorers can refresh their supplies.

  beach. They offer grand rewards to servants of darkness and certain 
  death for do-gooders who stumble into their lair.

  pilgrimage across the subcontinent.

swamp. Home to numerous individuals from the evil demihuman races but

  during raids.

which they will confer upon champions who can prove their worthiness in 
combat.

Points of Interest:
- Two of the great golden keys securing their ancient secrets were lost 
  in titanic battles; one against the militarized forces of the undead,

  provide access to finally slaying the greatest enemies of
