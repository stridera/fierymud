ABORT

Usage: abort

Prematurely terminates the casting of a spell.  If you have reason to
believe that a spell, already in the process of casting, will not be
needed, you can ABORT it.

AC

The lower your character's AC (acronym for "armor class"), the less
chance he or she will have of getting injured in battle.  Armor class
numbers often run into the negatives (good!) and it is not uncommon
for an extremely high-level player to have -100 AC.

Examples:
   100          Naked person
     0          Heavily armored
   -51          Very heavily armored
  -100          Nigh-nonhittable


NOTE:  Within the mud code, armor classes are actually calculated on a
-10 to 10 scale.  Why?  Because THAC0's are calculated on a 0-20
scale, and thus must be equated against a -10 to 10 armor class scale
instead of a -100 to 100 scale.  What does this mean to you?  It means
that as far as the mud is concerned, if you have, for instance, a -55
armor class, you *really* only have a -50 armor class.  The values are
all rounded off to the closest ten.  So, when you are choosing your
equipment, disregard those few extra armor class points unless they
take you over the next 10th number value.

The help entry under THAC0 further explains this hit/miss system.

ADVANCE

Usage: advance <victim> <level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
immlist will automatically be recreated.

Example:

  > advance rasmussen 34

AFK

 A person who is AFK is Away From their Keyboard and won't be around to
interact with you if you try to talk to them.

#0
AGGR

Usage: aggr <hitpoints>
       aggr off

Sets your aggressiveness to monsters.  When the value is greater
than 0 and you're in good health, you will attack mobiles that
are aggressive to you.  It's checked whenever you enter a room.

When your hit points are below the aggr value, or below the
current "wimpy" setting, you won't be aggressive.

AGGRO

"Aggro" is an adjective meaning aggressive or violent.

#0
ALERT

FieryMUD has multiple positions of resting. Although it's not fully implemented
you can be resting while standing.  When this happens you will be unable to do
many things, like move, participate in combat etc...  If you find yourself in
this odd state, type alert to make yourself more alert.

ALIAS ALIASES

Usage: alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias. This supports aliases, not scripting entire routines.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

ALIGNMENT
 
A character's alignment is their standing in the moral grounds
of good and evil.  Some subclasses such as Ranger require a certain
alignment in order for their spells to work (in this case, good)
and many items require their holder to be of a certain alignment
to use the item.
 
Before level 35, a character will be able to see if they are Good,
Neutral, or Evil by checking SCORE or ATTRIBUTE.  At level 35 they
will be able to see numbers.
 
1000 to 350: Good
349 to -349: Neutral
-350 to -1000: Evil

"ANIMATE DEAD"
 
===========================
Usage           : cast 'animate dead' <corpse/corpse name>
Area of effect  : corpses
Aggressive      : N/A
Accumulative    : no
Duration        : random based on life of corpse
Type of spell   : ??
Class           : Necromancer
===========================
 
Animate Dead is a necromancer's power base.  Though a low circle, it is the
spell they will use continually for the rest of their career.  Animate dead 
will bring undead of various types into the realm based on the necromancer's 
level and the level of the corpse it is cast on.  A necromancer's charisma
is used to help control the animated corpse: a caster with a higher charisma
will have a much better chance of having powerful creatures not turning on
him or her.  The hitpoints of the newly animated undead will also be in part
determined by the hitpoints of the necromancer, so that a necromancer with
better hitpoints will animate corpses that will have more HP than a necromancer
of the same level who has fewer HP.  All raised creatures will eventually
crumble into dust, but their existance can be prolonged by casting "preserve"
on the corpse before animating it.  Necromancers use vast amounts of 
concentration to maintain control over their undead minions.  As a result a
necromancer can only control so many at once of varying strength levels.
Some undead will be raised and free themselves from the control of their master
immediately, turning on everyone in sight.  If you see a horde of undead
without a master, just run.

ANON ANONYMOUS

This is a toggle that allows players level 50 and over to hide their 
class and level from view of the general population.  If someone is
anonymous then they have chosen not to show their skills to the world
at large.

#0
ANSI COLOR

Usage: color [off | sparse | normal | complete]

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color sparse
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, uncolored messages will not be slowed down at all.

ANTIPALADIN ANTI-PALADIN

   Anti-Paladins are the essence of evil embodied.  These unholy warriors have
made dark pacts with the forces of Chaos and Destruction, which give them 
special powers.  Anti-Paladins seek the complete annihilation of good, and 
revel in pain, chaos, and destruction.  They have been known to be able to harm
with a simple touch, and fight with incredible bloodlust.  They are often seen
riding jet black unearthly mounts that resemble horses.  Anti-Paladins are 
granted the ability to sense good in the world around them and are granted a
degree of protection from it.

Primary Attributes:	Strength, Constitution, Wisdom
Allowed Races:		Human, Orc

   *Note:	Anti-Paladins are a sub-class of Warrior and, as with all
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

Being one of the evil classes of the realms this class will one day not be 
allowed into good aligned towns without being attacked by the guards as an
outcast member of society.

Area of Effect  : Room
Aggressive      : Yes
Accumulative    : No
Duration        : Proficiency
Classes         : Monk           Level 75
===============================================
 
The anthem of the apocalypse stirs up feelings of hatred, confusing
the monk's opponents and causing them to preferentially attack the
monk.  This is a quest chant.

AREAS ZONES
 
This is a list of the major areas in Fiery.  The most important thing about
an area is its level range.  The ranges listed here are estimates based on
a group with 2-4 characters, for the most part.  As you get above level 80,
larger groups are often necessary.
 
Fighting in towns and cities is usually a very bad idea, as the guards will
assist against you - no matter what you may be fighting.

ASSASSINS

Assassins are trained killers, and while they may not be the strongest or
toughest of adversaries, their knowledge of anatomy, weapons, and poisons
makes them a feared hand of death in the realms.  Assassins are generally
evil, killing for their own gains, but some are even neutral and do it
only for the work, taking no special pleasure in death itself.  The
stealth of a trained assassin can make them seem to have faded from
reality completely, yet reappear behind you with daggers in hand, and all
without an ounce of magic. Assassins are known to be outlawed from entering
good aligned or lawful towns, villages, and enclaves.

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity
Allowed Races:		Human, Duergar, Orc

   *Note:	Assassins are a sub-class of Rogue and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

Being one of the evil classes of the realms this class will one day not be 
allowed into good aligned towns without being attacked by the guards as an
outcast member of society.

str, int, wis, dex, con, cha, AC, hit and damroll, alignment, etc.
Though these are also shown in SCORE, ATTRIBUTE will show you your
natural str, dex, con, int, wis, and cha.  It will look something
like this:
 
Str: 100(91)    Int: 96(91)    Wis: 100(93)
Dex: 81(86)    Con: 66(63)    Cha: 53(50)
 
The number in parenthesis is your natural score.  The number outside
the parenthesis is what it's being modified to by spells, equipment,
etc.
 
Characters below level 15 will only be able to see "Fantastic",
"Pretty Good", "Not bad", "Fair", and "Bad" rather than numbers.
 
Characters below 35 will only be able to see their alignment
as good, neutral or evil.  Once they get past 35, numbers will
become visible.  At 35, they will also become able to see their
hitroll, damroll and saves in vague terms such as "Bad", "Fair", etc.
 
At level 50, characters will be able to see their armor class (AC)
in numbers as well.
 
At level 75, a character can see their hitroll, damroll and
saving throws in numbers.
 
Note that different attribute scores may look the same on members
of different races, but in practice they will actually be quite
different.  A human's 100 str is not the same as a barbarian's
100 str, but that same human's 70 int will be more than the
barbarian's 70 int.

AUTOBOOT REBOOT

Usage:
  autoboot off           - disable automatic reboot
  autoboot on            - enable automatic reboot
  autoboot warntime <mn> - warnings begin <mn> minutes before reboot
  autoboot [<hr>][:<mn>] - reboot in <hr> hours, <mn> minutes
  autoboot postpone      - postpone reboot for double warntime minutes

Fiery will normally reboot itself periodically.  When it starts up, it
decides when the next reboot will occur.  The autoboot command can be
used to adjust and control this behavior.  During the final two minutes
before an automatic reboot, mortal logins will be disabled.

"autoboot warntime" is used to set the warning time.  Reboot warnings will
begin this amount of time prior to the reboot.

"autoboot postpone" is used to delay an automatic reboot.  It can be used
by lower-level deities.  It will work if the automatic reboot is imminent -
in other words, if warnings have started.  It will cause the reboot to
be delayed for 2x(warning time).  For example, if the warning time were
set to 15 minutes, and the reboot was 5 minutes away, issuing
"autoboot postpone" would cause the reboot to be canceled and set to
occur in 30 minutes.

A single number will be interpreted as a number of hours: "autoboot 14"
would set the reboot to happen in 14 hours.  A colon may be used to
indicate minutes: "autoboot 2:30" will cause a reboot in 2.5 hours.
The hours may be omitted.  To cause the reboot in 4 minutes, enter
"autoboot :4".

#100
AUTOEXIT

Usage: toggle autoexit

Toggles the automatic display of currently available exits.  Not all
possible exits will be displayed, only those immediately available.
If a door is closed it will show up as a possible exit, but noted
with a '#'. I.e.  -E# -N.
In that example a door is closed to the east and there is an open exit to
the north.
Note, autoexits won't show you hidden doors or exits.

BACKSTAB

=========================================
Syntax     : backstab [<victim>]
Aggressive : Yes
Classes    : Assassin       Level 1
           : Mercenary      Level 11
           : Rogue          Level 10
           : Thief          Level 1
=========================================

A backstab is an attempt to sneak up on the victim and place a weapon
in the victim's back, at exactly the point where it will do the most
damage.  The amount of damage incurred is dependent on the proficiency
of the backstabber and the strength of the weapon.

You may only backstab with piercing weapons, like daggers.  Assassins
with enough proficiency in dual wield may double-backstab if wielding
two piercing weapons.

BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu


 IT IS ESSENTIAL YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE INTERNET IS SUBDIVIDED BEFORE YOU 
 BAN LARGE NETS OF ADDRESSES WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE DOING, BAD BAD.

 So, how is the internet Subdivided?  We won't go into CIDR blocking here
but it is essential you understand that if you ban network 4. you just
prevented 16,777,216 possible addresses from playing on FieryMUD.

 IP addresses are divided up into 4 sets of 8 bits (8, octet, get it?) in
the format w.x.y.z  The value of w x and/or y will determine what size
network the player is originating from.  The internet is divided up into
classes based on these sizes. The are referred to as Class A, Class B, and
Class C.  Other classes exist but aren't relevant to play on FieryMUD.

 Without going into bit-wise explanation of the divisions the following 
table defines the classes.

      Class         Networks
        A     1.0.0.0     -  126.0.0.0
	B     128.0.0.0   -  192.167.0.0
	C     192.168.0.0 +

 The size of a class A netblock is 16,777,216 possible addresses.
 The size of a class B netblock is 65,536 possible addresses. 
 The size of a class C netblock is 256 possible addresses.

 So, when you ban someone try to ban their IP individually. If they are some
dynamic addressed dialup, and come back to cause trouble, ban them based on
a class C subnet size.  Example:

	Doofus needs banning and he's playing from 004.234.055.011.

   Ban him based on his IP and disconnected him.  If he returns in a
   few minutes with the IP address of 004.234.055.233 then it's fairly
   safe to assume that he's getting dynamic addresses from his dialup
   connection. SO:

        Doofus gets banned on 004.234.055 using just the first 3 octets.

Allegedly, we have this limited octet covering entire nets and subnets working.
so this is a sound strategy.  Remember when you ban 3 octets you are just 
preventing 256 (254 really) addresses from playing.  Note that it is an
unfortunate side affect that valid users will be blocked when we ban people.
That's what the gods list is for. 

NEVER EVER BAN JUST THE FIRST ONE OR TWO OCTETS ONLY. NEVER EVER EVER EVER
EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER
EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER
EVER BAN ANY IP ADDRESS STARTING WITH 127.x.y.z, or 163.246.y.z EVER EVER!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

low rate of success.  Banish is not a very well defined spell, and is
likely to change in the near future.  It is also a quest spell, and the
gods must be petitioned to receive it.

BARBARIANS
 
Belonging to the primitive culture, they possess rudimentary skills
and simple manufacturing techniques.  They excel in brute combat and
fight with uncanny vigor and frenzy, moreso towards unfamiliar
spellcasters alike.  Barbarians are also adept at surprising opponents
have an exceptional endurance for even the most extreme of conditions.

BARDS
      This class has yet to be implemented.
   Bards are performers of incredible skill, as well as con artists of equal 
skill.  Many bards are not as selfish as most rogues, preferring their musical 
craft over pick-pocketing.  Bards are often seen accompanying the forces
of good, lending their songs of courage and hope, and utilizing their abilities
to pick locks.  Some call bards hopeless romantics, caught up in their ballads,
but any bard will tell you differently, pointing out that not everyone cares
only for themselves.  The influence a bard has over others is truly amazing.
They have the ability to read a crowd and alter the emotions of that crowd.
Bards have been known, in fact, to boost the morale of soldiers to incredible 
heights, casting their own enchantment on those that hear their songs of
bravery, peace, love, and heroism.

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma
Allowed Races:		Human, Half-Elf

  *Note:	Bards are a sub-class of Rogue and, as with all other 
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

for information on proficiency level.

    You do the damage of a nekkid piece of cheese.
    You do the damage of a small sword.
    You do the damage of a flaming claymore.

If a monk is holding or wielding anything in either hand then the barehand
advantage is negated and they will hit worse than sorcerers.

           : Ranger         Level 1
           : Warrior        Level 1
================================================
 
The success of a bash depends upon how experienced you are.  Bashing someone
is an attempt to 'knock' that person over.  If you succeed, you will inflict
minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on its rear.  The victim will be
unable to fight or issue any commands for a few rounds of combat.  If you
miss, you lose your balance and fall and suffer similar penalties from being
in the prone position.  

Regardless of success or failure, bash will make you unable to type commands
for a couple rounds of combat, including fleeing.

Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict more damage.
A successful bash will stop someone from casting a spell.

BERSERKERS
	This class has not been implemented.
   Berserkers are warriors that have learned to harness their rage and call
upon it in combat to enhance their abilities.  When in a berserk rage, they will
not be able to recognize friend from foe and often end up attacking others
without provocation.  The look in the eyes of an enraged Berserker is said to be
very haunting, and often the last sight you do see.

Allowed Races:		Dwarf, Troll, Ogre, Barbarian

   *Note:	Berserkers are a sub-class of Warrior and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain

BOAT

A boat is needed to cross deep water.  There is no trick to using
boats - the only requirement is to carry one in your inventory.

Boats are available in various places.  Newer players may find
that sorcerers are reliable sources of boats due to the "minor
creation" spell, which can be used to create a raft.  The drawback
of the raft is that it's rather heavy.

Flying makes boats unnecessary.

BODYSLAM
 
Usage: bodyslam <victim>
 
Bodyslam is an innate skill available to larger races, such as
Barbarians and Ogres.  Its effect is similar to bash, knocking
the victim to the ground and causing minor damage and preventing
him/her from making any kind of action, including combat, for a
short amount of time.  However, if you fail a bodyslam, you will
instead be unable to fight back.  A successful bodyslam will
stop someone from casting a spell.

BRIEF
Usage: toggle brief

Toggle "brief mode".  When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of
the room you are in; only the name of the room and the people and objects
there.  Unless you're very familiar with the area in which you're traveling,
however, it is not advisable to use this command.  Frequently, you will find
small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

If you explicitly type 'look', you will always see the full room description,
even in BRIEF mode.

BUILD BUILDING BUILDERS

        Once submitted, to FieryMUD or FieryWEB, any concept, 
        idea and the culmination thereof, referred to as work
        or material, becomes property of FieryMUD and will be
        used at sole discretion of the owner of FieryMUD in
        any way shape or form the owner finds appropriate.
        Submission of material or work requires reading of
        appropriate statements and instructions, of which
        this is, in advance of any submission.  Therefore
        submission of ideas or concepts is validation of 
        acceptance of this former implicit policy now 
        explicit.

To submit an idea for building an area you must write the story of the area
outlining its plot and importance to the region or realm.  Suggest a level
range for your potential area in a 30 level block, 20-50, 35-75, etc. 
Explain why the important characters in your area are important. Define 
important objects and what they lend to the plot.  Be ready to work!  We
require builders to construct areas in order of difficulty.  That means
your first area will be a newbie area, your next area will be a lower level
area, next mid level, etc... So if you want to build the homeland of hot
dragon death area then get ready to build 5 areas before it.  Do a gut
check here and now.  Look at the Bazillion newbie areas we have and how the
areas taper off after that, many people come on build a simple newbie area
and learn what degree of work it really entails and run for the hills never
getting to implement their dream dragon area.  If you have imagination and
motivation this will be the place for you.

Building here on Fiery is rather simple. To make it even easier, this help
file will give a few tips and rules that should be followed to make all the
zones on the MUD look uniform. More will be added as time goes on.

Rooms:
1) Always capitalize all important words in the room name.
Example: A Long Tunnel in Darkwood Forest
2) Always leave a three space indentation at the start of every room
description.

Objects:
1) An object's short description should never contain capitalized letters
unless they are proper nouns.
Example: a wicked mace named 'Bone Crusher' or an ivory handled dagger
2) Long descriptions should have the same structure as a proper sentence,
including first word capitalization and punctuation. Only proper nouns should
be capitalized in the long description.
3) An object should have on average an extra description of at least one or
two lines in length.
4) Try to keep objects balanced with the zone. Look at other zones or ask for
help if you are unsure of item balance.

Mobiles:
1) Mobile short descriptions should not contain any capitalized letters unless
they are proper nouns. No ANSI code should be used before the first word of
their short description.
2) Mobile long descriptions should be structured like a proper sentence,
containing no capitalized words except for the first word and any proper
nouns.
3) Mobiles should not have unrealistic flags or levels. No level 50 fleas
or baby orcs with haste and stone skin please.

CHANT

This is a monk skill gained from training with another monk.
The chants of monks can enable monks to change their moods
and the moods of others with their deep resonant voices.
The deep and pleasing tones can have a variety of affects
on the monk and those who are in his vicinity depending on
the songs chanted.

CHARISMA

Charisma is a measure of your appeal, and is not necessarily limited
to your good looks (or your lack of such).  Charisma only plays into
a few aspects, including your chance to tame, the exchange rate you
get at the bank, and your rate of success in animate dead.

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Alex Fletcher (Furry), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, and David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementers Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- And, of course, Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

CLAN "CLAN COMMAND"
 
Usage: clan <subcommand> [<parameters>]
 
The clan command encapsulates most of the functionality of clans (if you
don't know what they are, see help CLANS).  This command allows players
to join or administrate clans via a number of subcommands.  Different
subcommands are available to different players.  Some actions are only
valid for non-members, and some are limited to privileged clan members.
For instance, "clan apply" only makes sense for players who are not in
a clan, while "clan promote" is only available to clan members with that
privilege.
 
The following clan subcommands are available: apply, demote, deposit,
enroll, expel, info, list, promote, quit, reject, set, status, tell, who,
and withdraw.  Usage and additional help for each subcommand can be found
by typing "help clan <subcommand>".
 
See also: CLANS, CLAN INFO, CLAN PRIVILEGES
#0
"CLAN APPLY"
 
Usage: clan apply <clan>
 
After gathering clan info and deciding a clan is right for you,
you should apply to the clan.  You can specify the clan by either
its number or abbreviation as given in the clan list.
 
Examples:
    clan apply 3
    clan apply potc
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN LIST, CLAN INFO, CLAN ENROLL, CLAN REJECT
#0
"CLAN CREATE"
 
Usage: clan create <clan name>
 
This command is used to create a new clan.  The specified clan
name is used for both the new clan's name and abbreviation, so
one should typically specify the new clan's abbreviation when
creating the clan, then use the "clan set name" command to
set the full name of the clan.  You can specify non-alphabetic
characters and color codes in the abbreviation, and they will
be ignored when referring to the clan in other clan commands.
For instance, naming a clan >>PotC<<, will allow you to later
refer to it as simply potc.
 
Examples:
    clan create >>PotC<<
    clan set name potc Pirates of the Caribbean
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN SET, CLAN DESTROY
#100
"CLAN DEMOTE"
 
Usage: clan demote <player>
 
This command allows a clan leader or privileged clan member to demote
subordinate clan members down through the clan ranks.  The subordinate
is only demoted one level at a time.  You cannot demote someone at the
same rank as you.
 
Examples:
    clan demote laochan
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN PROMOTE, CLAN PRIVILEGES
#0
"CLAN DEPOSIT"
 
Usage: clan deposit <amount>
 
This command allows clan members and alts to deposit currency into their
clan's general fund.
 
Examples:
    clan deposit 1000 platinum
    clan deposit 200 silver 500 copper
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN WITHDRAW
#0
"CLAN DESTROY"
 
Usage: clan destroy <clan>
 
This command is used to destroy an existing clan.  This action is
not reversible from within the game.  You can specify the clan
either using its abbreviation or number as given by the "clan list"
command.
 
When a clan is destroyed, all members, alts, and applicants are
removed from the clan.  The clan file is then backed up on the
server.
 
Examples:
    clan destroy potc
    clan destroy 3
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN CREATE
#100
"CLAN ENROLL"
 
Usage: clan enroll <player>
 
This command allows clan leaders and privileged clan members to enroll
applicants into their clan.
 
Examples:
    clan enroll laochan
    clan enroll noobie
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN APPLY, CLAN REJECT, CLAN PRIVILEGES
#0
"CLAN EXPEL"
 
Usage: clan expel <player>
 
This command allows clan leaders and privileged clan members to remove
any undesirable or worthless members from the clan ranks.  A clan member
may only expel a clan member below their rank.
 
Examples:
    clan expel laochan
    clan expel noobie
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN QUIT, CLAN DEMOTE, CLAN PRIVILEGES
#0
"CLAN INFO"
 
Usage: clan info [<clan>]
 
This command displays information about a given clan.  Either a clan
number or abbreviation, as given by the "clan list" command, can be
use to identify a clan.  Anyone can use the "clan info" command to
view public information about a clan, but only clan members and alts
will be able to see the full information about their own clan.  Clan
members and alts may omit the clan to view information about their
own clan.
 
Examples:
    clan info potc
    clan info
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN LIST, CLAN SET
#0
"CLAN LIST"
 
Usage: clan list
 
This command simply lists all clans in the realm.  Some basic
information about each clan is shown on the list.  The "clan info"
command can be used to determine more information about a clan.
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN INFO
#0
"CLAN PRIVILEGES"
 
Within a clan, some actions are considered "privileged" and can only be
performed by clan members with the requisite privilege.  For instance,
demotions may only be performed by clan members with the 'demote'
privilege.  Each clan privilege can be set to a rank within a clan.  If
a member is at or above the rank defined for a privilege, he/she is
considered to have that privilege.  For instance, if the 'withdraw'
privilege is set to rank 5, all members rank 5 and higher may withdraw
from the clan bank.
 
A clan privilege's rank may only be set by a clan leader, or equivalently
a clan member at the highest rank in his/her clan, by the use of the
"clan set privilege" subcommand.  See CLAN SET for more information.
 
Each clan privilege typically corresponds to a clan subcommand or set
ability.  There are currently 11 defined clan privileges: demote, enroll,
expel, promote, setalt, setappfee, setapplev, setdesc, setdues, settitle,
and withdraw.  Summaries of each privilege follow.
 
Privilege      Associated ability
-------------  ---------------------------------------------------------
demote         Demotion of members below the privileged member's rank
enroll         Admission of clan applicants
expel          Expulsion of members below the privileged member's rank
promote        Promotion of members below the privileged member's rank
setalt         Administration of clan member alts
setappfee      Changing a clan's application fee
setapplev      Changing a clan's minimum application level
setdesc        Modification of clan description
setdues        Changing a clan's monthly member dues
settitle       Modification of clan rank titless
withdraw       Withdrawal of money from clan bank

"CLAN PROMOTE"

Usage: clan promote <player>

This command allows a clan leader or privileged clan member to promote
subordinate clan members up through the clan ranks.  The subordinate
is only promoted one level at a time.  You cannot promote someone at the
same rank as you.

Example:
    clan promote laochan

"CLAN QUIT"

This command allows any clan member or alt to revoke their membership
in a clan.
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN EXPEL
#0
"CLAN REJECT"
 
Usage: clan reject <player>
 
This command allows clan leaders and privileged clan members to reject
applicants into their clan.  A clan member can use the "clan reject"
subcommand if they have the enroll privilege.
 
Examples:
    clan reject laochan
    clan reject noobie
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN APPLY, CLAN ENROLL, CLAN PRIVILEGES
#0
"CLAN SNOOP"
 
Usage: clan snoop <clan>
       clan snoop all
       clan snoop off
 
The clan snoop command allows a deity to monitor the clan tell
channel of one or all clans.  When snooping a clan, a deity will
see all communication on the clan's channel.  A deity can also
snoop all clans at once.

Snooping a clan changes the way the "clan tell" command behaves
for that deity.  When snooping a single clan, clan tell should be
used without specifying a clan.  When snooping all clans, the
deity must specify to which clan they want to send the clan tell.
 
Examples:
    clan snoop potc
    clan tell hey potc'ers!

    clan snoop all
    clan tell potc heh heh

"CLAN STATUS"
 
Usage: clan status
 
This command displays your status within your clan, telling you whether
you are an applicant, alt, or full member, and listing privileges and
rank.
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN INFO
#0
"CLAN TELL" CTELL
 
Usage: clan tell [#<rank>] <message>
       ctell [#<rank>] <message>
 
Clan tell is a communication channel only available to members of a clan.
Members of one clan will not be able to see another clan's clan tell,
only their own.  The "ctell" command is just an alias for "clan tell", and
can also be abbreviated as "ct".  The optional rank parameter allows you
to limit who sees your clan communication to a given rank and higher.  If
you are using standard ANSI color, clan tell shows up as bright purple.

Examples:
    ct Hey guys!
    clan tell #4 Haha, only rank 4 and above can see this!
    ct #5 Hey don't tell the newbies, but...
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, CLAN INFO, GOSSIP, GTELL

"CLAN WHO"
 
Usage: clan who
 
Much like the normal "who" command, "clan who" displays all members
of one's clan, listing those who are online.  It also displays any
applicants to a clan.
 
See also: CLAN, CLANS, WHO, CLAN INFO
#0
"CLAN WITHDRAW"
 
Usage: clan withdraw <amount>
 
This command allows a privileged clan member to withdraw funds from
their clan bank.
 
Examples:
    clan withdraw 100 silver
    clan withdraw 90 copper 50 gold

CLASS SUB-CLASS CLASSES SUBCLASS SUB_CLASS
 
Fiery now offers a wide range of character classes and abilities, all of
which originate from four basic classes. Each of the basic classes have
extraordinary growth potential throughout game play. As you begin your
journey, you are limited to only these five classes. As you play and
experience new areas and levels, you are faced with a decision
to either specialize in a subclass, or retain your original class. If you
choose to specialize, your abilities and powers will expand accordingly,
leading the way to very powerful characters.
 
However, you may wish to remain a basic class. A basic class is not empty
by far, and though it has no advantages that some of the subclasses offer,
it also has no disabilities or drawbacks.  Once you choose a subclass you
cannot look back. You can not combine subclasses; you can only choose one.
And when you do choose, your current skills/spells may change to reflect
your choice. If you choose to become a Cryomancer, you will cast down
the spells of a basic sorcerer to embrace the art of Cryomancy. These
subclasses are obtained, if you so choose, by first becoming the proper
level. All subclasses have a minimum level of 10. The actual choice will
be made by finding the master of the subclass (see subclass_subclassname)
to teach you. The Master will ask you to prove your worthiness of the class
by sending you on a quest.  Actually finding the master may be a quest unto
itself.  Think hard on your choice.
 
The maximum level to subclass is determined by your basic class.
Warriors and rogues have until level 25, clerics have until level
35, and sorcerers have until level 45 to complete their subclass
quests.
 
Important NOTE: Not all races can be all classes! See the help on each
                class to determine specifics.
 
Warrior           Cleric        Sorcerer        Rogue      
-------           ------        --------        -----       
 
Paladin           Priest        Pyromancer      Assassin    
Anti-Paladin      Diabolist     Cryomancer      Thief
Ranger            Druid         Necromancer     Mercenary                          
Monk
 
Type "subclass" to get a list of available subclasses for your race.
Note: This command only works some of the time. If you do not see
any subclasses available, try looking at the help file on your class
(help subclass_warrior, help subclass_rogue, etc.).

CONJURER

This class is unavailable pending completion.

Conjurers are mages that have concentrated on the essence of creation. 
These mages can take raw ethereal power and transform it into material
substances.  Conjurers have even been known to infuse material items and
beings with magical power and enchantments.  Unlike Illusionists,
conjurers practice true creation instead of perceived creation, which
gives them higher stability, but a limited range of effects.  Some of the
greatest monsters and magical items written of in all the lore of the
world were created by Conjurers. 

Primary Attributes:	Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Gnome, Orc, Half-Elf, Halfling

   *Note:	Conjurers are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

CONSIDER

Usage: consider <victim>

Consider is used to compare your groups strength in battle versus that of
a potential foe. You will receive a message indicating a rough estimate,
which is by no means exact, of your groups chances.  Consider does
not take hitpoints/special attacks/damage into account.  Nor does it consider
racial differences currently, just understand a mid level dragon will be a bit
more difficult than a mid level guard.

Example:

  > consider guard
Now where did that chicken go?

This message is for a group. So if you are a magic user don't think you can
solo this guy.

CONSTITUTION

Constitution is a measure of your physical fortitude and endurance.
It has a marked effect on your hit points--for high constitution
values, your hit points rise by a multiple of your level.
Constitution also determines how many movement points you start off
with.

Your paralyze save is helped by your constitution.  Dwarves, gnomes,
and halflings also get bonuses to their spell, paralyze, and wand
saves depending on their constitution.

CRYOMANCER

Cryomancers are mages that have melded the essence of water with their
own powers, giving them incredible influence over the primal element of
water.  The element of water is mainly associated with emotions and
transformation.  These mages use water in its frozen aspect to shred any
who oppose them.  From turning the ground beneath their foes to ice, mud,
or even a flood up to encasing them in solid ice, a cryomancer is surely
not one to mess with.  Cryomancers have been seen walking upon the surface
of water as well as walking beneath it with no want of air.  They are seen
as ambassadors to the material plane from the plane of water, and have no
problems with any other elementalists, but harbor no love for fire
elementalists. 

Primary Attributes:	Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Gnome, Orc, Half-Elf, Halfling

   *Note:	Cryomancers are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

DEATH DIEING DYING

Well, if your hitpoints make it to -10 you DIE like the dogs you are. What
does this mean to you?  You will lose approximately 20 percent of the exp
you needed to get to what would have been your next level at time of death.
If you die and lose enough exp you can lose your current level and access
to any spells or skills gained at that level.  Losing level is bad news.
I would suggest game play practices that avoid it.  A corpse is generated
of your former self when you fall to the ground dead.  This corpse will be
located where you died and will contain all the possessions you had on your
body at time of death.  To get your possessions back you will need to go to
your corpse and loot it. When you die you will reenter the game at your
point of sanctuary, whatever that point that is, and be severely wounded.

of a deity quest before attainment.

DEITY RELIGION
&2(inactive entry)&0

THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!

Each character on Fiery must select a deity at creation.  Some characters
will go on to be some type of religious class, such as cleric or shaman. 
These classes rely on their deity to grow in power, and to gain new spells
and skills.  The different deities represented on Fiery control various
spheres of influence, such as a particular race, or type of magic.  Each
has unique power, and bestows benefits upon followers as they increase in
level.  This increase in level is a reflection that the character is
growing closer to the deity in the religious relationship.  

Each deity has a specific alignment range that followers must adhere to. 
In the case of alignment deviation, punishment is swift, and in most
cases, quite harsh. As religious characters grow in level, the chances of
divine intervention on their behalf is greatly increased.  Divine
intervention can be something as simple as smiting an opponent in battle,
or allowing your spells to be cast instantaneously during a combat, or
something as dramatic as an avatar joining your group to kill a religious
opponent.  

Currently all a character has to do in order to 'worship' a deity is
choose at character creation, and then maintain the appropriate alignment
throughout their adventures on Fiery.  As levels increase, benefits and
punishments are much more meaningful to the game world as a whole.

DELETED DELETION IDLE

Currently players can not delete themselves. There is no ETA on when this
functionality will return.

Idle players, those who rarely if ever logon after creation will be deleted
due to inactivity.  There is also a an inactivity time out on player files
for players of higher level.  Level 1 players have 4 weeks until deletion.
For each additional level you get 3 more days of idle time above that. So, 
a level 10 player...
                    30 days + (3days*10) = 60 days of time before deletion
due to being idle in the pfile.
a level 50 player...
		    30 days + (3days*50) = 180 days of time before deletion
due to being idle in the pfile.

We think this is more than fair and it will serve to mop up the pfile for
faster access by real players.

DEXTERITY

Dexterity is a measure of your agility and flexibility, and is
actually one of the most flexible and versatile attributes, showing
up in many places.  It plays into success rates for numerous skills,
including conceal, sneak, instant kill, disarm, corner, hide, and
steal.  It also helps determine how much damage lay hands does.

Of course, dexterity plays an integral role in combat.  High
dexterity values also help lower your AC.  It helps your chance to
flee.  Perhaps most importantly, dexterity plays directly into the
hit-miss calculations, helping you dodge, parry, and ripost your
enemy's attacks.  Your dexterity attribute helps you stay standing
when someone casts earthquake, too.

Dexterity plays a small part in determining your wand and breath
saves.  It also determines how many items you can carry at your
level.

DIABOLIST

Diabolists are clerics that have followed the dark paths to the heart
of chaos. Their allegiance with the great powers of evil gives them
powers to summon demons and cause other great effects of chaos and
destruction. It has been said that the greatest Diabolists resemble the
demons they have charge over.  It is also said to never trust the word of
a Diabolist, for they see life itself as a disease to be cut from the very
fabric of existence and will always turn on you.  Diabolists seek only to
plunge the world into chaos, and undo the creation of all good things. 

Primary Attributes:	Wisdom, Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Gnome, Duergar, Orc

   *Note:	Diabolists are a sub-class of Cleric and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain

Being one of the evil classes of the realms this class will one day not be

"DRAGONS HEALTH" DH

=================================================
Usage         : cast 'dragons health' <victim>
Area of effect: Victim
Aggressive    : No
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Enchantment
Classes       : Cleric         Circle 12
              : Priest         Circle 12
=================================================

Similar to the weaker vitality and endurance spells, dragons health allows
a cleric to invoke significantly more health into a creature with just a
touch.  This vitalization increases the victim hitpoints temporarily, in
an amount dependant on the cleric's proficiency.  When this spell wears off,
the victim's hitpoints will drop by the amount they were increased, and
if one's hitpoints are negative, it is possible to die.  This is a quest
spell.

DRUID

Druids are clerics that have taken to the forces of nature as their
source of power.  Nature has an incredible influence over all things in
the world, and Druids are able to utilize that influence.  Druids tend not
to tangle in the ways of good or evil, but live solitary lives in their
forest homes.  Druids often cooperate with Rangers to the ends of
preserving nature, but do not follow them on their biased path.  Druids are
benevolent, and seek to aid all living things, and will leave well enough
alone as long as their forests aren't harmed.  However, harming the realm
of a Druid can cause the realm itself to raise up against you and will
surely be your demise. 

Primary Attributes:	Wisdom, Charisma
Allowed Races:		Humans, Half-Elf

   *Note:	Druids are a sub-class of Cleric and, as with all other 
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

           : Warrior        Level 25
================================================
 
Dual wield is a skill that allows you to wield two weapons at once, one
in each hand.  Your ability to wield a second weapon is dependent on the
weight of the second weapon and your proficiency at dual wield.  The
higher your dual wield proficiency, the more often you will hit with
both weapons in a combat round.
 
Dual wield is also required for Assassins' double backstab.  It is not
possible to backstab with two weapons unless you are able to wield two
weapons.  Dual wield does not apply to combat without weapons, including
Monks' barehand skill.

DWARF DWARVES "MOUNTAIN DWARF"
 
The most noble race of demihumans, they dwell deep inside the
earth, forging great cities and waging massive wars against the
forces of chaos and evil.  Dwarves have much in common with the
rock and gems they love to work - both hard and unyielding, they
are renown for their sturdy constitution and bullish stubbornness
as much as their long beards and mustaches.  Commonly stocky
and muscular, they range from about four to four-and-a-half feet
in size.  Their skin is typically tan to a light brown with ruddy
cheeks, and bright eyes.  A dwarf's mortal enemy is a dark dwarf,
or duergar.

ENFORCEMENT PUNISHMENT JUSTICE

First, in every incident the deity addressing the problem MUST get
both sides of the story.  Talk to the primary people involved, then
talk to other people removed from the situation if you are still
uncertain.  Use your knowledge of each of the players (ie: a known 
liar, or someone with an extensively negative 'notes' file would be
taken less at his/her word than someone with a clean record).

Also, make a note on the player in question.  We implemented this
functionality for a reason.  "Player did this, I followed these
steps, he was warned as a XX offense, and punished by YY." as per
the stages of punishment outlined below.


1st offense) Talk to the player, 1-on-1, tell them what rule they
   broke, reason to them that no fancy talk on their part changes 
   that fact, and make it clear that this is their only reprocution-
   less warning and next time has consequences.  Make a NOTE about 
   the discussion, and known alternate/primary characters on the PC.

2nd offense) Take the player in question aside and inform them they
   had been warned.  They are now subject to punishment. The uniform
   punishment for this stage is that the offending character is to
   be frozen for 1 days time.  Exceptions to this would be for an
   inappropriate use of a communication channel, in which 'mute'
   would be used as an appropriate substitution for freeze.  Make
   a NOTE on the player.

3rd offense) Tell the player this is their final warning punishment.
   The offending character is to lose 1/2 of their levels, rounded
   down.  If you do not have the authority to re-level a character,
   make a note on the 'justice' thread on the forums and someone
   else will take action as soon as possible.  Freeze the character
   until such time as 1/2 their levels are taken.  The deity who
   enacts the 1/2 leveling make a note on the 'justice' thread 
   saying the punishment has been enforced.  Make sure the player
   realizes that this is their LAST chance to shape up and tell
   them what awaits them upon a 4th offense.

4th offense) This is the final offense.  We no longer consider this
   person a viable addition to the playerbase and they are to be
   removed.  Each of his/her known characters is to be frozen, set
   to level 1, and placed in the 'icebox' (room 1202).  His/her
   current IP address is to be banned.  Please note this last
   action in the 'justice' thread on the forums.

These rules are in an attempt to unify punishment and decisions 
made among the deity staff of FieryMUD.  Please suggest
modifications and additions to these rules.

Different vendors, banks and merchants about the realms will exchange higher
level coins for lower level ones and vice versa.  This will happen more often
for a profit for the exchanger than not.  The raw exchange values are

	1 Gold coin 	= 10 silver coins
	1 Silver coin 	= 10 copper coins

"EYE GOUGE" EYEGOUGE GOUGE

=========================================
Syntax    : gouge <target>
Aggressive: Yes
Classes   : Rogue
=========================================

A somewhat "dirty" tactic, gouging an opponent's eyes out promises
blindness and the inability to see for an indefinite period of time.
In gouging out eyes, rogues use their bare hands, jamming their
thumbs forcefully into enemies' eye sockets.  This is no attack for
the weak of heart.  Gouging eyes out also causes a small amount of
damage, dependent on the rogue's level.

Victims of eye gouge may have their vision restored by any of the
normal methods.

FINISHED COMPLETE
The following areas are supposedly complete, and should be running on
the game:

Update (02/16/01):
Tanle has gone through the whole help file and adjusted incorrectly spelled
words.  New zones and expanded old zones coming soon.  Fiery Island, Griffin
Isle, and Nordus quests should be finished.  Previously all the subclass
quests were written and implemented.

Update (11/18/00):
A whole year later, Tanle finds this file.  Help areas is current, so I
would suggest checking that file for all the zones, as much has happened.

Update (12/20/99):
Azkrael just found this help file. Next file swap, Nordus, Fiery Island, 
Kings of Dreams, and Griffin Isle will be added. Anduin is completed after
about ten years of being in beta state and was added a month ago. Now that 
we're sure nobody will be assassinated by their own guildmaster, we'll be
moving bad guys up there.

Update (4/19/99):
Graveyard is now implemented.
Rockwell should have been included on the first edit.

Dancing Dolphin Inn and Beachhead are now done....good luck getting

FORGET

Usage: forget <spellname>
       forget all

Forget is used by a caster to "erase" the spellname from his
memorization queue. If the spellname given is not listed in the
caster's queue, then it is removed from the MEMORIZED list. Only 
one occurence of the spellname will be removed at a time.  Once a
spell is forgotten, another spell may be added. (Only a spell of
the same circle may replace the spell forgotten.)
Example:

    If Harnak wanted to forget magic missile, he would type:
    >forget magic

    If he wanted to forget EVERYTHING he's memorized, he'd type:
    >forget all

================================================
Usage         : cast 'freeze' <victim>
Aggressive    : Yes
Type of spell : Sphere of Water
Classes       : Cryomancer     Circle 7
================================================

This spell calls upon a Cryomancer's mastery of cold, taking the
water particles of the very air around a victim and amplifying them,
damaging them severely.  It also has a chance to freeze them solid,

Classes	       : Cryomancer     Circle 5
================================================

This spell invokes a colder than ice blast of air against the foes of the magic
user.  The mind numbing cold circles all in the area causing great damage to
those who can suffer from cold or fail to save.  This appears to be the area
effect version of the Freeze spell but weaker in nature.

life force of the victim with an amount of hp directly proportional to the
clerics proficiency at healing.

This spell also cures blindness and disease, much like heal.

GNOMES
 
Cousin to the dwarves, they resemble them as small, thin, and
nimble kin. Noticeably though, Gnomes tend to keep their beards
shorter and stylishly-trimmed and they take pride in their
enormous noses (often twice the size of any normal human or
dwarf's).  their skin is usually a dark tan to woody brown,
often with hints of gray, startling to pale-blue eyes and
sandy-pale hair.  Millennia of underground dwelling have given
them excellent vision in the dark and their keen intelligence
make them a cunning adversary.

GROUP

Usage	: group <player>
	: group all

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be
shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of
the killing blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have
been participating in the fight.

To form a groups certain steps must be accomplished.  
First, a group leader must be chosen.

Once this is accomplished, each person who wishes to be included into the
group must first type consent <leader>.

Then, it is up to the leader to type group <player>, in order to include
that player into the group.  If the player wishing to be grouped is also
following the leader, and the leader wishes to group those players that
are following all at once, the leader must only type group all.

If the leader wishes to remove a certain member from the group, for which
ever reason, the leader simply must type group <name> again.

To remove yourself from a group, simply type group <yourname>

To see the status of those you are grouped with, such as their hitpoints
and movements points, type group with no arguments.

Area of effect: Group

Duration      : Proficiency

              : Priest         Circle 8
=================================================

With sufficient skill in healing, it becomes second nature to a cleric,
giving the ability to heal multiple targets simultaneously.  This
talent is manifested in the group heal spell.  It heals all members
of the caster's group who are in the same room as the cleric, and can
only be cast when in a group.  The restorative power of this spell is
equivalent to heal.  This is a quest spell that may only be attained
through deity quest.

GUILD

The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and    
perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded, so that only members
may enter the building. Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade. Note that the Thieves Guild is
hidden somewhere in town. If you can't find it, you probably chose the
wrong profession for your character.  :)

A guildhouse like this is ENTIRELY DIFFERENT from that used by formal guilds
(see: GUILDS). All classes get their own sort of guildhouse where they can
practice skills. A formal guild's guildhouse is a members-only club that
can (but doesn't always) allow all sorts of people into it as long as they
have a key. Clear as mud?

GUILDS CLANS

Guilds are groupings of like-minded people who have written a formal 
declaration of intent to the mud's administration which has been accepted
for use. Guilds get some very important bonuses: They get their own global
communication channel (see CTELL), their own guild house (see GUILD), and
occasionally even their own shops and gear. This comes at a price: Guilds
are expensive to start and maintain, and every one of these perks are ungodly
expensive too.

Probably the hardest aspect of being a guild is that gods consider guilds
free game for bothering with roleplay and quests.

Clans are pretty much like guilds in terms of game mechanics, but instead
of being restricted by class, alignment, or race, are generally family
groupings of one specific race (like, the Bonechewer troll clan).

happily email you if you ask. His email is zzur@fierymud.org  :)

HALF-ELF HALF-ELVES HALF_ELF
 
Being of human stock, half-elves have features and benefits of both
their human and elven parents.  Their height usually ranges higher
and their weight heavier than common elves, growing as tall as 5 feet
and weighing up to 150 pounds.  Prejudice plays an influential role
to half-elves, as they are often seen as "half breeds" and outcasts
from elven society.

gate at another player somewhere else in the game.  Entering the passage at

of sin, only Evil-aligned characters may make use of the passages--those with

will actually cause them significant damage.  Those evil beings who react to
this righteous word in a particularly poor manner have a chance to actually go
blind or become paralyzed.  This spell resembles dispel evil with an area
effect nature.

HUMAN HUMANS
 
Ne'er seen one before eh?  Try using a mirror ya bloody oaf!
The most predominant race by far, they are crafty and cunning,
as they are greedy and unwittingly bent on self destruction.
Many of the more "older" or longer living races often view them
as foolish children, with their petty squabbles.  Well rounded
for any class or occupation are they, that humans can be found
throughout the known world as merchants, traders, soldiers,
pilgrims and oftentimes in tribal cultures, as well as holding
various social rank in larger cities.  As such, they hold better
overall ability scores than other races.

HUNTER

NOTE THIS CLASS HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE GAME

   Stalking their prey and closing in for the kill, hunters are in it purely
for the sport.  They have a sense of mastery over all forms of life, seeing
everything as a prey animal, and themselves as the predator.  Hunters have many
of the same skills as rangers, but are shunned by nature as wasteful killers.
Rangers and Druids harbor a particular hate toward Hunters.  Poaching in the
wild lands is a favorite pastime for hunters, and Druids and Rangers will stop
at nothing to eradicate any hunter within their realm.  Hunters, on the other 
hand, see Rangers and Druids as excellent prey, and choose to stalk them over
any other animals they may find.

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Troll, Duergar, Orc

   *Note:	Hunters are a sub-class of Rogue and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

Cryomancers study ice so intently that they may call
upon it to help protect them on the field of battle.

Identification of objects can be performed by simple examination

Type of spell : Sphere of Divination
Classes       : Sorcerer, Necromancer

This spell is extremely useful, as it will reveal much - though
not all! - about an item.  Though few classes actually get this
spell, Bigby sells scrolls of identify for a very reasonable cost.
This spell can be cast at an item you are wearing, in your
inventory, or on the ground.
 
Casting this spell at a player or mob will give you some interesting,
though essentially useless, information.

ILLUSIONIST
		REMOVED FROM THE GAME
   Illusionists are mages that have concentrated on the ability to alter
perception, and fool the weak of mind.  They understand all too well that seeing 
is believing, and can create an incredible array of effects ranging through all
the five senses.  Illusionists have been known to raze entire cities to the
ground, and leave the illusion of ruins, only to have the city evacuated and
overtaken without a single bit of damage.  The influence these mages have over
the weak minded often makes them seem as gods, but only to those that don't 
understand their power.

Primary Attributes:	Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Gnome, Orc, Half-Elf, Halfling

   *Note:	Illusionists are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

IMMORTALS IMMORTALITY 100

Immortals are people who have reached level 100. They should be respected
for having met and overcome the challenges of FieryMUD.

However, there are certain rules they must abide by:

0. They must not interfere with or hinder mortals.
1. That means no STAT'ing players or objects for mortals.
2. NO killing for mortals. Immortals cannot give away objects or equipment.
3. NO reimbursement for death traps or death, PERIOD.
4. NO experience reimbursement, PERIOD.
5. NO casting of spells on mortals for any reason, PERIOD.
6. Breaking any of these rules subject the immortal to immediate demotion.

Level 101's and above can do limited reimbursements for link problems
at their discretion.

Nobody likes rules, but we need them to keep the game fun and interesting.
The purpose of mudding is to overcome the challenge. We wouldn't dare deprive
you of that by assisting you in any way that would cause you to avoid such
challenges inherent in the game. :)

INNATE
 
Usage: innate
       innate <effect>
 
This command lists the innate skills and effects available for your race.
Innate skills can be used at any time, and are marked with a * symbol on the
list.  Innate effects are like special spells.  Some innate effects are
always present on you and are also marked with a * symbol.  Innate effects
on the list without a * are limited in duration and can only be used once in
a while.  You can invoke these by typing "innate <effect>", where effect is
the name of the innate effect.
 
For instance, Half-Elves have innate infravision always present, so they can
see in the dark all the time.  Dwarves have innate strength, but it is not
always present, so to invoke it they would simply type "innate strength".
Much like magic spells, innate effects that are not always present cannot
be invoked in rooms where magic is suppressed.

"INSTANT KILL"
 
================================================
Usage      : Involuntary
Aggressive : N/A
Classes    : Assassin       Level 1
================================================
 
This is an involuntary assassin skill.  When assassins become more skilled and
powerful, they slowly increase their vile abilities.  There exists a chance
while fighting with an assassin that they will almost innately find your weak
spot and seize the opportunity to kill you instantly.  Be warned.
 
At this time, this skill is not only involuntary but buggy.  You can't TELL
the game to instant-kill somebody.  It just happens.  Moreover, sometimes odd
things happen with it.  Please report when odd things happen. (see BUG)

Usage: iptables list
       iptables add <ip address>|<player>

coders need to connect via SSH and HTTP.

LAG LINKDEATH CRASH CRASHES RESET RESETS REIMBURSEMENT

This information will try and provide you with information
about FieryMUD's policies on LinkDeath, Lag, Crashes and Resets.

LAG - LAG is an extended period of time when "nothing happens" on the
MUD.  Lag is 99.9% of the time caused by YOUR Internet Provider.
FieryMUD is running on a nice fast new machine with an Internet connection
with tons of bandwidth.  We do not reimburse if you LinkDie because  
of severe lag caused by anything other than FieryMUD's own resources.   

LinkDeath - Occurs when a player is inactive for a long period of time.
If you LinkDie, you will drop all of your equipment and coins where
you were standing.  When you re-enter the game you will be at
The Forest Temple of Mielikki.  You will generally not be reimbursed for
LinkDeath unless it is deemed FieryMUD's fault, even then it is up to the
discretion of the FieryMUD Gods.
 
Crashes - Crashes happen for various reasons and cannot be controlled.
You may think that since crashes are caused by FieryMUD that you can
get a reimbursement.  If there is a crash and you lose something
(You DID remember to SAVE right?) it is up to the discretion of the gods
whether a reimbursement is possible in your case.

Resets - Resets happen on purpose.  There are an EXTREMELY few occurrences
of resets.  If they happen you will be given time to rent.  If not
you will most likely be forced to rent by a God anyway.  If by chance
a reset occurs and you do lose something, talk to a God a reimbursement
may be in order.

LAWS RULES SLAYER 

Note this statement. It is an overriding statement of policy about 
Fiery's Laws and Rules. Just because you can do something that will let 
you get around the spirit of the rules does NOT make it a legal action! 
Breaking the rules in spirit is the same as breaking the rules period 
and both will be treated the same. 

Fiery's Laws 

     I. No player killing or player stealing is allowed at this time, 
        except during special predefined "pk / psteal" periods. 
        Level 20 and below characters are off-limits at all times! They 
        cannot be attacked by other players until they are a bit more 
        capable of defending themselves. This includes assisting them 
        into an untimely demise. even indirectly, After that, its up to 
        the player to be responsible for him/herself. Note that a 
        character is not considered a 'newbie' if the human behind said 
        character plays other PCs of a level higher than 10. 

        The spirit of this rule is that new players are key to any game, 
        do not scare them off. 

    II. Exploiting bugs to build yourself an advantage is considered 
        cheating here. Players should report all bugs as soon as they 
        are discovered directly to a deity or on the forums. Using a 
        bug for personal gain is cheating and using a bug to harm other 
        players are vile crimes and will be dealt with by the gods 
        harshly. Ignorance is no excuse. 

        The spirit of this rule is that this is a game and it is meant 
        to be a fair game. If something seems too good to be true, it 
        is, and is likely a bug. Report it. Do not take the risk of 
        severe repercussions. 

   III. Absolutely zero harassment will be tolerated. While it is 
        certainly true that players are expected to fight their own 
        battles, this does not permit harassment of any sort. Any form 
        of harassment will not be tolerated. Immortality does not grant 
        immunity to this rule. People who harass other players will be 
        dealt with swiftly and firmly. 

        The spirit of this rule is that no one likes to be uncomfortable. 
        There is a reason all work places have a harassment policy in 
        place. 

    IV. You may NEVER have more than 2 characters on at a time. EVER! 
        Cutting link does NOT remove the character from the game - they 
        remain in game for approximately 5-10 minutes until they link out. 
        Having more than 2 characters rented at a time is permitted, you 
        are just not permitted to have more then two playing at once. 
        Storage characters are not permitted, keep your items on the 
        characters they belong on. Character sharing is also not 
        permitted and people caught sharing will be dealt with harshly. 

        The spirit of this rule is also fairness. Many muds allow only 
        one character simultaniously, do not abuse our rule and use 
        more than your allotted two character limit. 

     V. No botting.  This means no scripting or automating of tasks 
        that perform game play (in any fashion) for your charaters 
        while you are not actively playing the game.  You are 
        considered to be not actively playing if you have left you 
        computer to do other things or do not respond within 
        a few minutes or scripting is being used in place of you 
        playing the game. Idle triggers are acceptable as long as 
        the trigger uses a command that has no gameplay value; 
        such as emotes, socials, communication commands, and 
        other passive type commands. Active commands (casting, 
        using skills, etc...) are prohibitted in idle triggers. 
 
        The spirit of this rule is that the game should be fair for 
        everyone; if you you're not playing the game, you shouldn't 
        get the credit for progress by using automated means.  It 
        goes against the spirit of the game.  Violators will, at 
        minimum, have their skills set to minimum as a punishment. 

    VI. No kill stealing. When something is wounded, make certain via 
        shout or another channel that no one is battling this creature. 
        If the creature is claimed, it is off limits. These things are 
        logged so it is verifyable if you usurp a battle. If the creature 
        fully heals, then it is fair game for you to attack. Punishment 
        will be swift to violators and those grouped with the violator. 

        The spirit of this rule is simple, no one likes putting in a lot 
        of work to have it stolen away by someone else. Don't do it. 

These laws are subject to change at any time without warning especially 
as we're adding more and more features to the game or as new 
situations arise. If you have a problem with excess killing, talk 
to a god. Like these laws? Hate them? Leave suggestions. Also, please 
feel free to use the forums for questions and complaints:

LAYHANDS
 
Yes it's back! Warriors that have selected the path of pure good or
absolute evil have once again been granted the power of layhands.
This innate skill for both Paladins and Anti-Paladins can only be
used once every few mud hours.
 
For Paladins, layhands will heal an intended person or harm any 
undead mob you might use it on. It will target the paladin in question
if a target is not specified.
 
For Anti-Paladins, layhands will damage any non-evil, non-undead mob
targeted for a massive amount of damage. Counter to Paladins, Antis can
heal the undead with their layhands. Great for starting dangerous fights or
finishing off an unending battle.

If you'd like to see what items a shop has for sale, take a look at the
list.  The list contains all of the items currently for sale and in
what quantity.  The price for each item is also listed.  If you are
interested in a particular type of item, you can specify which items to
list.
 
Examples:
 
  > list             (list all items for sale)
  > list sword       (list all swords for sale)
 
In pet shops, the owner will try to gauge your mount skill, and estimate
how difficult it would be for you to control the mounts that are for
sale.  The estimates may not always be entirely accurate, but they
should keep you from wasting your money on a beast that will be entirely
too difficult for you to control.

Usage: memorize <spellname>

Memorize allows a caster to have spells ready to use.  To be a

memorize magic missile

                                         | Spells already in memory and ready  
( 1st circle)    1 - minor creation      | to cast!
					 -
You are currently memorizing:            | 
    6 seconds: ( 1st) magic missile      | Spells placed into memory queue and
					 | either being memorized into memory
   6 seconds remaining			 | or awaiting memorization time.

You continue your studies.               | This person is actually memorizing
					 | and not just standing around.
					 -
You can memorize (1)1st circle spell(s)  | How many more spells of what circles
					 | can still be queued and memorized.

Aggressive    : No
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Protection
Classes	      : Cryomancer, Pyromancer, Sorcerer
=================================================

A minor globe of invulnerability by name is somewhat deceptive, but then again
most of a sorcerer's early offensive ability is keyed off of striking fear into
potential foes.  The minor globe actually protects heavily against lower weaker
damage spells of all kinds. It has no defense for against more powerful spells.

"MINOR PARALYSIS"

Classes	      : Cryomancer, Pyromancer, Sorcerer
=================================================

Minor Paralysis, when inflicted, causes the victim failing to save to become
paralyzed, unable to move or start combat, for a period of time.  Since the
spell is quite weak however, if attacked, melee will disrupt the holding
power of the spell causing it to dissipate.

Usage	      : cast 'mirage' <self>
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Protection
Classes	      : Pyromancer     Circle 4
================================================

Those magic users who are learning the ways of fire can learn a method of
surrounding themselves with an intense layer of heat.  This layer of heat
envelopes the pyromancer causing the waves of heat dissipating off the body
to mask the exact location of major body parts, making them seem to appear
slightly elsewhere.  This has the benefit of making the sorcerer of fire a
bit more difficult to actually hit.

MONK

Monks are Warriors that, like Mystics, have learned to harness their inner
powers to manipulate their own abilities.  Monks keep pretty much to 
themselves, practicing their combat routines and meditating.  They keep a
neutral outlook on the world around them, and generally don't get involved in
wars, politics, or other people's plans toward earthly gains.  Monks instead 
use their abilities to influence the world to increase harmony and balance.  
They view the forces of good in a much better light than those of evil, 
however, due to evil's blatant disregard for life and harmony. Monks will 
always be more than happy to free an enemy from their earthly form and free
them from their karmic mistakes.

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom
Allowed Races:		Human, Half-Elf

   *Note:	Monks are a sub-class of Warrior and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

Note: At this time monks are a bit over powered.  As a result it is much
      more difficult to level.  This difficulty will be felt mostly shortly
      after subclassing.  It is possible for a new monk to die and loose
      up to four levels. But this danger will pass once the monk levels once
      as a monk.

moon's cool rays to shine in great concentration upon the immediate
area. Enemies of the druid will be severely chilled, and may even be
stricken with a temporary form of madness. However, the blind are

MYSTIC

THIS CLASS HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM FIERY, DO NOT ASK ABOUT IT.

Mystics are clerics that seek the path of self enlightenment as opposed to 
worshipping a being that already has it.  Believing that they are all a thread
of the universal fabric, and are one with the gods, and everything else around
them, these great seekers of inner peace are able to pull and tug a few of the
threads while in this limited physical form.  Mystics spend much of their time
deep in meditation discovering the ways of the universe and discovering their
own abilities.

Primary Attributes:	Wisdom, Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human

   *Note:	Mystics are a sub-class of Cleric and, as with all other

NECROMANCER
 
   Necromancers are mages that have concentrated on the magical aspects of
death.  They have the ability to slow down the process of decay in corpses,
then creating undead horrors from them.  This makes the necromancer a very
worthy adversary, being able to take the corpses of his foes and compelling
them into his service.  Great Necromancers have been known to rip the very
life essence from the bodies of their victims and cannibalize it to increase
their own power.
 
Primary Attributes:     Intelligence, Charisma, Hit Points
Allowed Races:          Human, Orc
 
   *Note:       Necromancers are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all

NEWBIE

Welcome to FieryMud! We hope you will check out these topics; they are of
special interest to new players.

First, beware of fighting in any towns. They are usually patrolled, and if
you are caught fighting, you will usually be eradicated. In other words, 
guards now usually assist ANY mob a player attacks within a town.

Second, locate newbie areas. Try to stay out of areas that are too high of
a level for you. If you die, you will end up in your home town,
but your corpse and all your money and gear will drop where you died and
you will need to go get it.

Stats of the game:
     99 mortal levels                 10 races, 4 class/13 subclass

Aggressive, tribal carnivores, Orcs live by the belief that expansion is
the key to survival, ergo the many wars they rage against humans, elves,

crossbreeding with other species and captives.  In general, they resemble
primitive humans with gray-green skin covered by coarse hair with their
stooped posture, low jutting forehead, and snout-like nose.  They average
about 5 to 6 feet in size and often employ sniping and ambush tactics in
combat.  Stereotypically, it is rumored that orcs would rather appear

PALADIN

   Paladins are defenders of the weak and upholders of the faith.  They
are an elite group of warriors that have made alliances to the divine
powers of good and are granted special abilities from that alliance.
Paladins are able to detect the presence of evil in the world around them
and are also granted a degree of protection from it.  Paladins have been
known to heal merely by touch, and are very quick to rescue those in
trouble.  Paladins are rarely seen without their mounts, which they have
an uncanny relationship with, often preferring the company of such a mount
to that of others.  Paladins value Order and Virtue, and strive to make
the world a place free of evil, chaos, and destruction.  As such, when
forced into combat with one of Good, with order and virtue, he feels a
loss to himself, while when fighting against those of loathsome stature,
with a tendency for malice and unjust means, they strengthen much more
potently.

   Primary Attributes:     Strength, Constitution, Wisdom
   Allowed Races:          Human

      *Note:       Paladins are a sub-class of Warrior and, as with all other
                   sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
                   degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

PALM

Usage: palm <item> <container>
       palm <item>

Drawing from their skill in concealing items, a thief may retrieve an
object from a container or the room, hiding the action from others in
the room, even if they can see the thief.  Only one item may be palmed
at a time.  Upon failure, onlookers will become aware of the action as
well as the attempt at subterfuge.  Success depends on the user's skill
in conceal, the item's weight, the user's dexterity, and the item level
versus the skill user's level.

PRAY

Usage: pray <spell>

Pray is used by cleric types in much the same way memorize is. If you're
not a cleric type, then it's just a cute social.

Pray allows a cleric to have spells ready to use.  To be a
able to use a spell the cleric must pray the spell so 
that they may be able to cast it at a later time.
The pray time of each spell depends on the spell level,
caster's intelligence, and caster's wisdom.

You must be resting to pray.

Example:
If Kozir wanted to pray cure light, he would type:

pray cure light

This places the spell cure light into a memorization queue.

typing pray without argument might produce..

You have memorized the following spells: -
                                         | Spells already in memory and ready  
( 1st circle)    1 - instant death       | to cast!
					 -
You are currently praying:               | 
    6 seconds: ( 1st) cure light         | Spells placed into memory queue and
					 | either being memorized into memory
   6 seconds remaining			 | or awaiting memorization time.
					 -
You continue your studies.               | This person is actually memorizing
					 | and not just standing around.
					 -
You can memorize (1)1st circle spell(s)  | How many more spells of what circles
					 | can still be queued and memorized.

object, that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed. 
If the argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its
inventory and equipment lying on the ground. 

If the argument is the name of a player, the player's inventory and
equipment will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her
connection.  For this reason, PURGE should only be used on players in
disciplinary situations. 

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge Pom
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

PYROMANCER

   Pyromancers are mages that have melded the essence of fire with their
own powers, giving them incredible influence over the prime element of
fire.  The element of fire is mainly associated with transmutation, and
these mages are more than willing to transform any transgressor into a
pile of ash.  Pyromancers have been known to summon great beings of living
flame to do their bidding, and also are seen as the ambassadors to the
material plane from the plane of fire.  Pyromancers don't have any problems
with any other elementalists, but harbor no love for water elementalists. 

Primary Attributes:	Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Gnome, Orc, Half-Elf, Halfling

   *Note:	Pyromancers are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

QUEST QUESTS

READ HELP QUEST_RULES!!

Quests on Fiery are automatic - they are run by the creatures you find about
the realm.  This is accomplished using some fancy quest code mixed with 
various other things.

Most quests currently are run under the following format, this is only a rough
sketch of how a number of the quests (including the subclass quests) run.  The
format is:
1) You enter the room where the Questmaster is and he says something.  Among 
   the things the creature says is a keyword.  Many times you must say the 
   keyword (which you must guess at) followed by a question mark.
2) The creature will probably then say something else, which you have to find
   a different keyword, which you should follow with a question mark.
3) That process might repeat some more, to get you information about the quest.
   Eventually the creature will say something where there are no more keywords,
   or they might suggest you leave them.  That would be your cue to go do what
   it asked you to.
4) You go do what the creature asked of you, kill someone, get something, 
   whatever.
5) Sometimes whatever they had you do is the prize, other times they give you 
   something in order to achieve your prize, and yet other times they want you
   to come back and say something specific or give them something, to redeem 
   your prize.

Example:
You enter Rogga's room.
Rogga says, 'Me big talking Creature, you not.'
You say, 'Creature?'
Rogga says, 'Yes Creature, me make you do things.'
You say, 'Things?'
Rogga says, 'Yes things, big hard things, go get big box'
You say, 'Box?'
Rogga says, 'Yes, box I lost long ago, go get for me.  You go now.'
Then you leave Rogga's room to get the box from where ever it may be.
If you don't know where it is, then that is part of your quest, to learn.
Come back to Rogga's room with box in hand.
give box rogga
Rogga says, 'Thanks, here your prize.'


The alternatives to the above format are not vastly different. The fact that
you have to run off and perform some task can be much the same. The Alternative
format is:
1) You enter the room where the Questmaster is and he says nothing. He/she/it
   could be a creature you've seen thousands of times all over the mud.  But,
   little known to you, it is programmed to interact with a particular class 
   or race or everyone in an unexpected way.
2) There are several ways to interact with the creature to have it indicate 
   that is may be more than it appears.  Saying words aloud is one way, the
   other ways are whisper and ask.  Note that whisper and ask accomplish the
   same thing so if you ask a creature hello and it doesn't respond then you
   wont have to whisper hello to double check.
3) A simple greeting like hello or hi will sometimes kick off the quest
   introduction banter.  After that, the rest of the quest will resemble the
   above procedure except that you may have to use ask or whisper instead of
   say.

"QUEST COMMAND"
 
Usage: quest advance <questname> <playername>
       quest complete <questname> <playername>
       quest erase <questname> <playername>
       quest fail <questname> <playername>
       quest restart <questname> <playername>
       quest rewind <questname> <playername>
       quest stage <questname> <playername>
       quest start <questname> <playername> [subclass]
       quest variable <questname> <playername> <varname> <varvalue>
 
This command is used to manage players' in-game quests.  Valid quest names are
listed using the command qlist.  Quest start may only be used for quests the
player has not already started.  Conversely, the other quest commands may only
be used for quests the player has already started.  For example, trying to fail
a quest on a player if he or she has not started it will cause an error.  A
player's quests can be listed using the stat command.
 
The quest command is also used in triggers to automate in-game quests.  It
should probably not be used at the prompt except to manually fix quest errors.
 
QUEST ADVANCE increases the player's stage in a given quest by one.  Attempting
to advance the quest stage past the quest's maximum stage or attempting to
advance a completed or failed quest will cause an error.
 
QUEST COMPLETE sets a given quest on a player to complete, preventing the player
from starting the quest again.  Subsequent attempts to advance, complete, start,
fail, or rewind a completed quest will cause an error.
 
QUEST ERASE removes the quest from a player, allowing the player to start the
quest again.  It will be like the player never started the quest.
 
QUEST FAIL sets a given quest on a player to failed, preventing the player from
starting the quest again.  Subsequent attempts to advance, complete, fail, or
rewind a failed quest will cause an error.
 
QUEST RESTART sets the given quest's stage back to 1.  The effect is similar to
a quest erase followed by a quest start, except quest variables will remain.
 
QUEST REWIND decreases the player's stage in a quest by one.  Attempting to
rewind the quest stage below 1 or to rewind a completed or failed quest will
cause an error.
 
QUEST STAGE simply shows a player's stage in a quest.  To access quest stages
in triggers, use a variable call similar to %actor.quest_stage[questname]%.
This variable call will return 0 for unstarted and failed quests.  To find out
whether a player has failed or completed a quest, use variable calls like
%actor.has_failed[questname]% and %actor.has_completed[questname]%.
 
QUEST START initializes a quest on a player, setting their stage to 1, if the
player has not already started the quest.  For a subclass quest, a quest start
command will have an extra parameter on the end, denoting the three-character
name of subclass, such as Ant.  The subclass must a valid one for that player's
class, or quest start will fail.  There should be no reason to use the subclass
feature of the quest command, as in-game subclass quests are implemented and
work fine.
 
QUEST VARIABLE allows the setting of quest variables on a player.  They can be
used to hold any kind of string or numerical value.  Quest variables may be
accessed within triggers using the call %actor.quest_var[questname:varname]%.
Uninitialized quest variables will return 0.  Unfortunately, quest variables
cannot be accessed outside of triggers.

QUEST_RULES

Within the realm of fiery there are two major quest types: Subclass quests
and Quest Spells quests.

Subclass quests are those quests in which a base class char may earn the
right to advance into a more specialized field. These quests are meant to 
challenge the individual as they prove their that they are truly worthy
enough to hold the rank of that specialized class. This means that the
person questing must earn their new rank and NOT have it given to them
via higher level support. This is a grouping mud but people must still
earn their rewards.

Acceptable level difference for Subclass quest support:
Warrior/Rogue support: 5 levels
Cleric/Mage support: 10 levels

Quest Spell quests are those quests either given through mob interaction
or through divine intervention. These quests are usually an attempt to 
test the questers knowledge of the MUD and skill within their class. We
ask that you not ruin these quests by providing the answers to whatever
riddle or supplying the quester with any knowledge that would remove the
challenge from the quest. You may however provide clues or hints.

Acceptable level difference for Quest Spell support:
20 levels for all classes

QUEST_SPELLS "QUEST SPELLS"

As players become more experienced and farther along their journey
through the realm of FieryMUD, they will be able to quest for
additional and more powerful spells.  These spells may be available
through automated in-game quests or through diety-assigned quests.
Sooner or later, all these quests will be done automatically through
NPC questmasters.

See the spell page for your class to see whether quest spells are
available and at what circle you may quest for them.

RACE RACES
 
A race is a sort of humanoid that possesses sentience and can adventure in
Fiery to gain exp and levels and neat stuff.  All races listed here are
currently available, though not always as starting races. Not all races can
become all classes -- in fact, many are severely limited. You can type SUBCLASS
to find out what classes are available to the race you currently play, if you
are of the correct level to do so. Note: This command only work some of the
time. If you do not see any subclasses available, try looking at the help file
on your class (help subclass_warrior, help subclass_rogue, etc.).
 
To become an evil race, you must petition to the gods and complete a minor quest
before being allowed to have an evil race character.  Evil races and good races
cannot see each other on the who list, send each other tells/moonwells, and
cannot be tracked by each other.  There are a few other restrictions as well,
so think carefully before deciding that you want an evil race character.
 
Starting races, the good races, include:
    Human         Gnome
    Half-Elf      Halfling
    Barbarian     Mountain Dwarf
 
Evil races are:
    Orc           Swamp Troll
    Duergar       Ogre

RACEWAR
&2(inactive entry)&0

One of Fiery's primary goals is to create a challenging, yet not
balanced, pk system that allows most players to go about their business
while allowing others the opportunity to engage their characters against
others'. To that end, we have created the racewar.

Any player may freely destroy another character (if she can), if that
other character is of a race coded as hostile to the player's. In other
words, orcs may freely attack elves, elves may attack orcs or dwarves,
trolls may attack halflings, etc. No race may kill its own.

Since most races will not mingle with others (it being difficult and
time-consuming to go far), and since the justice system employed by Fiery
punishes those who do attack other characters, this more or less ensures
that if someone does choose to pkill/psteal, she has given this matter
extensive thought and thoroughly developed her character.

RANGER

   Rangers, like Paladins, are warriors of Virtue, but seek the
preservation of nature.  They are good warriors opposed to the forces of
destruction and evil.  Rangers must stay in good graces with nature, and
if they fall into the ranks of evil, will lose all powers granted them
from nature.  Rangers have a relationship with animals that compares to
their relationship with people, and are able to make friends in the animal
kingdom easier than they do with other people.  Rangers are able to move
about outdoors with incredible stealth, and are able to detect the passage
of any being through any area. 

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Half-Elf


   *Note:	Rangers are a sub-class of Warrior and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

REMORT REMORTING REBIRTH

Please note that as of right now, there are very few people who can
actually start you on one of these quests, so it may take a while
for a request to be processed.
 
Rules for Remort
 
Qualifying for Remorting
Any persons looking to remort must fit the following qualifications.
1) One remort char will be allowed for each person at the following
intervals:
4 completed chars, one of each base class type
9 completed chars
14 completed chars
17 completed chars, meaning one of each class (at this stage the
only restriction is that only 1 char may remort at a time).
By "completed", it means a ** character with all possible quest
spells (if applicable, obviously an assassin doesn't have quest spells).
 
2) The questee must prove their knowledge of the realm by answer
10 mud knowledge questions from a list of 100. These will be randomly
chosen and given after verfication of other qualifications.
 
3) The char that shall be remorted must have a minimum of 2 weeks
(336 hours). Playtime with all other "completed" chars is a minimum
of 100 hours playtime.
 
4) Must not have any outstanding quests on any chars. You may
not start new spell/eq quests while one of your characters is
on a remort quest, except spell quests for the remort character.
 
 
Remort Rules
1) A grouping restriction of no more than 5 levels above the
remorting char shall remain in effect. This includes help of
any kind such as transportion such as moonwells and CR such
as res and shift corpse and support such as invis, stone etc...
However, feel free to group with those within the accepted
level range, which includes all characters of lower level
than the remort.
 
2) To be considered "completed" in regards to the remort the
char must re-quest for and complete ALL possible spell quests.
(Quests are considered part of leveling up a char and thus
must be completed during remort as well.)
 
Failure to comply with these rules will be a demotion back to
level 1 and no benifits upon regaining ** status. In other
words, failing to respect these rules is failing to respect
the remort quest and result in revoke of the priviledge.
 
 
Reward for a Successfully Completed Remort
The character will be given:
 
1) All maxed stats.
 
2) All maxed skills for their class. Spells must be re-quested
for as noted in the Rules section.
 
3) 50% additional HP (based on their L99 hp before maxed stats
and without eq). This means that if you have 950 as a ** without
eq before remorting, your bonus would be 475 for a new total
of 1475 (assuming you rolled the same amount of hp the
second time through).
 
4) The person shall be given access to the evil races choices
for their next char set. You may still quest for evil characters
in the usual way, but this is an added bonus for completing
the remort quest.
 
 
 
If there are any questions, please contact your local Deity for more information.

REPLY

Usage: reply <message>

This command will send a reply to the last person to send you a message
using TELL.  It works just as if you had typed 'tell <player> <message>'
but makes it a bit easier.  It can also be very useful in case someone
invisible sends you a message.

Example:

Ras tells you, 'Hi!'
> reply hey
You tell Ras, 'hey'
>
Someone tells you, 'I am your secret admirer.'
> reply Who are you?
You tell someone, 'Who are you?'

           : Ranger         Level 35
           : Warrior        Level 15
================================================
 
As a general rule in a group, the person who takes the first hit will
receive most or all of the damage from the opponent.  Often, this
person will become low on hit points and will need to be rescued.  To
rescue someone is to attempt to take the place of that person and have
the monster hit you instead.  You can only "turn" one opponent for each
attempt.
 
See also: GROUP, KICK, FLEE
#0
RESTORE RRESTORE

Usage: restore <player | mobile>

RESTORE restores a player or mobile to full hit and movement points.
If used on immortals, it also sets all skill levels to 100%. The command
RRESTORE does a realm restore. This will restore everyone logged in.

#100
RESURRECT

=================================================
Usage         : cast 'resurrect' <target>
Area of effect: Target
Aggressive    : No
Duration      : Instantaneous
Type of spell : Sphere of Healing
Classes       : Cleric         Circle 11
              : Diabolist      Circle 11
              : Priest         Circle 11
=================================================

The resurrect spell returns a player to life at the site of their
corpse, restoring a portion of the experience they lost at the time of
death.  The caster of the spell must be in the same room as the corpse,
and be able to see it.  The player to be resurrected must be online, in
the game, and also visible to the caster.  When the target player is
resurrected, all items in the corpse will be placed in his/her
inventory.  Resurrect is a quest spell.

RETREAT
 
================================================
Syntax     : retreat <direction>
Aggressive : No
Classes    : Anti-Paladin   Level 60
           : Mercenary      Level 40
           : Paladin        Level 60
           : Warrior        Level 60
================================================
 
Sometimes things get just a little too heated in a fight, and one
might find it necessary to get out of harm's way.  Those especially
skilled at combat can learn techniques to safely retreat from battle
when 'flee' is too risky.  When using retreat, the player must give
the direction to make a retreat attempt towards.

RIDING RIDE
 
This is the skill of horsemanship.  The better you are, the less likely it is
that you will fall to the ground or be thrown off.  Use the mount command
to get on, and then just move around normally, by entering the cardinal
direction in which you wish to move.
 
Pet shops owners will try to indicate how easy a mount would be for you
to control when you type "list".

ROGUE

   Rogues are miscreants of all types: Burglars, beggars, and pick-pockets.
Rogues make their living off those that make a living.  Not above killing, or
being selfish, some rogues find this path to be all they need.  Some rogues have
been known to forget specializing and after they have learned all they can go on
to learn an entirely different profession.

Allowed Races:		Human, Dwarf, Troll, Duergar, Ogre, Orc
			Half-Elf, Barbarian, Halfling

SAFEFALL

Safefall will allow a monk to safely roll out of a fall from a particular
altitude.  Gravity however will have its revenge.  A monk can only survive
a fall from a few hundred feet higher than that of normal folk.

SANCTUARY
 
===================================================
Area of effect: Target
Aggressive    : No
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Protection
===================================================
 
The sanctuary spell blesses the target with a divine aura
of protection, halving the damage the target would normally
take.  Unfortunately, the divine beings whose power once
caused this spell to work are now gone, and sanctuary can
only be found on relics of the old age.

Usage	      : cast 'sane mind' <victim>
Aggressive    : No
Accumulative  : No
Type of spell : Sphere of Enchantment
Classes	      : Diabolist
================================================

Will remove the insanity flag from an affected target.

SAVE

Usage: save

This command has been disabled due to abuse...BAD MORTALS!

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

See also: INN, RENT
#0
"SAVING THROWS" "SAVING SPELL" "ROD" "PAR" "BRE" "SPE" "PET"

These are the saving throws, the lower the number the better chance you
have at not getting hit with a spell that is being cast at you.  You will
be unable to see your saving throws until you gain a certain amount of exp.
Note:  Currently these are not fully implemented.

PAR is paralysis, how well you save against demobilizing spells.
ROD is for wands, how well you save against someone using a wand on you.
PET is petrification, not exactly sure the difference between this and PAR.
BRE is breath, ever have a dragon burn you to a crisp with their breath? This
    helps with that.
SPE is just spell, all the rest of them for the most part.
Some spells cannot be saved unless you somehow dodge them.
#0
SAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT '

Usage: say | shout
       tell | whisper | ask <player> <string>

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

Examples:

  > say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:

  > ' hello there.

Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.
You must be level 2 before you can use shout.

See also: GSAY, NOREPEAT, QSAY, REPLY, PETITION, GOSSIP, LARYNGITIS
#0
SCAN

Usage: scan
       scan <direction>

Scan allows you to see who is in the surrounding rooms.  It will
list the inhabitants of adjacent rooms and a rough description of
their stance.  Most people will only be able to see one room away,
but rogues and assassins typically have well-trained eyesight,
allowing them to see three rooms away.  However, the farsee spell
can increase this distance as much as three rooms, depending on
the &8user's&0 proficiency in the sphere of divination.

You can also supply a direction when scanning that limits your
scan to that direction.

Currently, there is an issue that prevents you from seeing mobiles
and players in dark rooms.  This behavior may or may not persist.

#0
SCORE
 
Usage: score
 
Provides useful information on your status such as age, hit points,
movement points, armor class, alignment, experience points, gold
on hand, how long you've been playing, your level, and active spells,
among other things.
 
Sometimes a score will only be available once you have reached a certain
level.  These levels are as follows:
 
Characters below level 15 will only be able to see "Fantastic",
"Pretty Good", "Not bad", "Fair", and "Bad" rather than numbers
on their str, dex, int, wis, con, and cha.
 
Characters below 35 will only be able to see their alignment
as good, neutral or evil.  Once they get past 35, numbers will
become visible.  At 35, they will also become able to see their
hitroll, damroll and saves in vague terms such as "Bad", "Fair", etc.
 
At level 50, characters will be able to see their armor class (AC)
in numbers as well.
 
At level 75, a character can see their hitroll, damroll and
saving throws in numbers.

SCRIBE

=======================================================================
Usage	  : scribe <spellname>
       	    -- where <spellname> is the complete name of the spell.  
Classes	  : Conjurer, Cryomancer, Necromancer, Pyromancer, Ranger,
		    Sorcerer
=======================================================================

   Scribe is used by sorcerers (and sub-classes) to keep a written copy of
each spell in their spellbook.  The spellbook is an integral part of the
spell memorization process, and each spell must be scribed into a
spellbook before the sorcerer can memorize the spell. 

To scribe a spell, the spellbook must be held, and a quill must be used.

NOTE- Abbreviations are accepted for spellname, however, since many spells
have similar abbreviations, they may conflict with what actually gets
written to the spellbook.

Scribing must be done at one's guild - your guildmaster knows
all of your class's spells and is ready to teach them.
To scribe in your guild, hold your spellbook and a quill, sit,
and type "scribe <spellname>".  To see what spells are currently
scribed in your spellbook, just look at the spellbook.

#0
SEARCH

Usage: search
       search <container>
       search <doorname>

Searching allows you to find things that are hidden beyond your perceptive
ability.  Each time you search, you remove hide points from any hidden
items or people in the location you are searching.  When their hide points
drop below your perception stat, they become visible.  A thorough search
of a room is also necessary to reveal hidden or secret doors, which cannot
be passed through until made visible.

Using the search command without parameters merely searches the room,
and will reveal hidden mobiles, players, objects, and doors.  If the
name of a hidden door in the room is known, searching for that exit
specifically will cause it to be found immediately.  Searching in a
container allows discovery of hidden objects inside.

Examples:
    search bag
    search trapdoor

SEDIT

Usage: sedit <shop's virtual number>

This will set up a new shop in OLC, or edit one already defined. SHOW
SHOPS will define what shops are already set up (Fiery convention dictates
that the vnum of the shop will be the same as its room vnum, to keep
things easier). 

To set up a shop, you need to have: the vnum of the shopkeeper, the vnum
of the shop's room(s), the vnums of all objects to be sold. You must also
define hours of operation (if desired) and buy/sell messages.

"SEED OF DESTRUCTION"
 
===============================================
Usage           : chant 'seed of destruction'
Area of Effect  : Room
Aggressive      : Yes
Accumulative    : No
Duration        : Proficiency
Classes         : Monk           Level 99
===============================================
 
Especially skilled monks become so crafty at mental persuasion
that they become able to convince others of complete falsehoods.
This chant plants the belief in the victim that they are
extremely ill, causing them to weaken in constitution and
strength.  Mind over matter indeed.  This is a quest chant.

#0
SELL

Usage: sell [#] <item>
       sell <#>.<item>

If you'd like to sell an item to a shopkeeper, trying selling it to them.
Most shops specialize in what they will buy, so you may have to look around
to find a buyer for your items.
 
Examples:
 
  > sell sword       (sell the first sword in your inventory)
  > sell 3 sword     (sell the first three swords in your inventory)

For now, shopkeepers seem uninterested in buying anything, including
items they have sold. Hopefully they will be more interested in the
near future!

"SENSE LIFE"

==================================================
Usage	      : cast 'sense life' <self>
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Dependent on proficiency of caster
Type of spell : Sphere of Divination
Classes       : Cleric, Diabolist, Priest, Ranger
==================================================

This spell will enable you to sense hidden life forms in a room.
Creatures affected by INVISIBILITY and/or HIDE (i.e., hiding) will
appear as definite life forms, although you will be unable to discern
their true nature.

See also: HIDE, INVISIBILITY
#0
SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

SHADOW
 
================================================
Usage      : shadow <victim>
           : shadow self
           : shadow
Aggressive : No
Classes    : Rogue          Level 60
           : Assassin       Level 40
================================================
 
Those who operate in darkness often find the need to follow targets
without their knowledge.  The shadow skill accomplishes this by working
similar to the follow command, but suppressing any indication to the
victim and room when successful.  Upon failure, onlookers will become
aware of the shadower's subterfuge, and the shadower may be forced into
visibility if hidden.  The skill works while hidden or sneaking, but
onlookers will still be aware of sneaking movements if they have sense
life.

Duration        : Proficiency
Classes         : Monk           Level 30

This song fills the monk's victims with sorrowful depression,
clouding their vision with shadows and hindering their ability
to make melee attacks.

SHAMANS

   Shaman are the manipulators of the spirit realms, utilizing the spirits of
nature to accomplish many feats, these uncivilized work with the raw power
around them to harm, heal and manipulate.  Some Shaman forget choosing a Totem
and continue to dabble with the spirit world until they learn all they can and 
go on to learn an entirely different profession.

Allowed Races:		Troll, Ogre, Orc, Barbarian

No one seems sure what Shamans do. This is uncharted territory.

SHAPECHANGE
 
Usage:
  shapechange mammal | bird | reptile | fish | aquatic
  shapechange tank | damager | tracker | travel
  shapechange <animal>
  shapechange me
  shapechange
 
Shapechange is a Druid innate skill.  It will change you into an
animal whose power depends on your level and dedication to
neutrality.  Various animals will have different skills available.
 
There are three ways to specify what you want to shapechange into.
You can specify the animal class (mammal, bird, reptile, or fish),
the job (tank, damager, tracker, or travel), or a specific animal
by name.
 
For instance, to randomly pick a bird shapechange, you could simply
type "shapechange bird" to get the strongest bird possible to your
level and alignment.
 
But if you knew you wanted to be a golden eagle, you could type
"shapechange eagle".  However, in this case, there is no guarantee
you will be able to turn into an eagle.  If your level or neutrality
are not sufficient, you might shapechange into a lesser bird instead.
 
Specifying an animal job will attempt to pick the strongest possible
animal in that job for your level and alignment, regardless of animal
class.  For instance, "shapechange damager" might get you a panther
or it might get you a cobra.  If you're really unlucky, you might
turn into a rat.
 
When shapechanged, to change back to yourself, type "shapechange me".
Using the shapechange command without arguments while shapechanged
will tell you how long you have been shapechanged.
  
In addition to the four animal classes, there is the aquatic
pseudoclass.  It includes all the fish and certain other water-only
animals.  You can only shapechange into an aquatic animal when in
the water.  These aquatic animals will be unable to leave the water
and enter land rooms.
 
The animals available, in order of increasing power in each class and
job, are as follows:
 
MAMMALS
  rabbit, rat, bat, horse, badger, manatee, wolf, panther, dolphin,
  bear, cheetah, rhino, orca
 
BIRDS
  sparrow, bluebird, robin, owl, hawk, falcon, buzzard,
  eagle, ostrich
 
REPTILES
  snake, lizard, chameleon, asp, tortoise, cobra, turtle,
  viper, crocodile, anaconda
 
FISH
  piranah, eel, swordfish, stingray, lamprey, shark
 
AQUATIC
  piranah, eel, swordfish, stingray, manatee, lamprey, dolphin,
  turtle, shark, orca
 
DAMAGER
  rat, piranah, lizard, eel, rabbit, falcon, lamprey, eagle,
  panther, cobra, cheetah, ostrich, viper,
 
TRAVEL
  sparrow, bluebird, bat, robin, owl, swordfish, raven, hawk,
  horse, dolphin
 
TANK
  chameleon, badger, tortoise, manatee, turtle, bear, rhino,
  crocodile, anaconda, orca
 
TRACKER
  snake, asp, stingray, buzzard, wolf, shark

"SHIFT CORPSE"

=================================================
Usage         : cast 'shift corpse' <victim>
Aggressive    : No
Duration      : Instantaneous
Type of spell : Sphere of Summoning
Classes       : Necromancer    Circle 13
=================================================

Summon corpse's bigger brother, shift corpse allows the caster to commune
with death and transport a player's corpse from anywhere within the realm
and bring it to the caster's feet.  In order to be successful, the caster
must have the consent of the player whose corpse is being summoned.  This
is a quest spell.

"SHOCKING GRASP"
 
===================================================
Usage         : cast 'shocking grasp' <target>
Area of effect: <target>
Aggressive    : Yes
Duration      : Instantaneous
Type of spell : Sphere of Air
Classes       : Conjurer, Cryomancer, Necromancer,
              : Ranger, Sorcerer
===================================================
 
The spell caster attempts to grasp the enemy with a bare hand, but for
only the briefest of instants.  On contact, the target is blasted with
a searing shock of electricity, causing great pain.

SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

Shopkeepers seem uninterested in all types of items for now. Hopefully, their
interest will be peaked in the future!

SHOW

Usage: show <mode> [argument]

Valid Modes:

death          errors         godrooms       houses
player         rent           shops          stats
zones   

The SHOW command displays information.  Some modes of show require additional
information, such as a player name.

   death: Shows all death traps in the game.
  errors: Shows errant rooms.
godrooms: Shows the rooms in the 'god zone'.
  houses: Shows the houses that are currently defined.
  player: Shows player summary information, simply provide a player name.
    rent: Shows the filename and path to a players rent file.
   shops: Shows all the shops in the game and their buy/sell parameters.
   stats: Shows game status information including players in game, mobs etc.
   zones: Shows all the zones in the game and their current reset status.
          An age of -1 means it is in the 'to be reset next' queue.

#100
SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.

NOW        Just like reboot 'cept shutdown now will shutdown without saving
	   characters or olc info.

SILENCE

================================================
Usage	      : cast 'silence' <victim>
Aggressive    : Yes
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Enchantment
Classes	      : Cleric, Diabolist, Priest

This spell will allow the cast the prevent the victim from speaking. This has
the affect of preventing the victim from casting.

SIZE
 
The size of a player or mob can affect many things.  Smaller races
tend to have fewer hit points and could even be knocked over by
heavy winds if they are not careful.  Larger races, on the other
hand, tend to be blessed with better health and can withstand
much more punishment as a result.  Some skills affected by size
are listed below.
 
*You can only throatcut a mob within one size category of yourself.
*You can only bash a mob within one size category of yourself.
 
Some approximations of sizes in the MUD and examples are:
Small: 2'-3'     ex: a gnome
Medium: 4'-7'    ex: a human
Large: 8'-15'    ex: a barbarian
Huge: 16'-31'    ex: a frost giant
Giant: 32'-63'    ex: a remorhaz
Gargantuan: 64'+ ex: Sagece of Raymif
 
Note that mobs with a high weight can be of a higher size than
their height may suggest.  This is why dwarves are medium and halflings
are small, even though a tall halfling might be about the same height
as a short dwarf.

SKILL SKILLS

Usage: skills

Use this command to get a list of your skills and an indication of your
proficiency in them.

Most skills must be exercised in order to improve, but you can only
improve them a certain amount per level.  When you've maximized your
proficiency in a skill for your current level, an asterisk ('*') will
appear next to it.  When a skill is as good as it's ever going to
get, two hyphens will appear as well ('-*-').

SLEEP

SLEEP is both a command and the name of a spell.

The SLEEP command puts you to sleep, allowing you to regain your health more
quickly.  You will be largely unaware of your surroundings while asleep.
You can awaken yourself with the WAKE command.

The SLEEP spell forces the victim into a magical sleep such that they cannot
be awakened until the spell wears off.

=================================================
Usage        : cast 'sleep' <victim>
Accumulative : Yes (Duration)
Duration     : Depends on Proficiency
Aggressive   : If failed, yes
Type of Spell: Sphere of Enchantment
Classes	     : Conjurer, Cryomancer, Necromancer,
	     : Pyromancer, Sorcerer
=================================================

If failing saving throw versus spell, the person will fall asleep.
A person who is affected by sleep can only be awakened if attacked.

SMOKE
 
================================================
Usage         : cast 'smoke' <victim>
Aggressive    : Yes
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Fire
Classes       : Pyromancer     Circle 3
================================================
 
Sorcerers who have mastered fire have mastered all forms of it.  Those who do
can manipulate a targeted flow of pyroclastic ash to blind their foes causing
intense pain and the normal side effects associated with blindness.

SNEAK
 
================================================
Usage      : <automatic when moving while hidden>
Aggressive : no

             Rogue        Level 10
             Thief        Level 1
================================================
 
When attempting to move while hidden, you will normally lose a
certain amount of hide points per step.  Higher proficiency in
the sneak skill helps decrease the chance that this will occur.

#0
SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command; 
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.
#100
SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.
Of course, Zzur took it away, so we should all cry then gather arms and
slay Zzur!

SOCIALS

Usage: <social> [<victim>]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action,
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on
the social.  (Slap a dragon lately?)

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

"SONATA OF MALAISE"
 
===============================================
Usage           : chant 'sonata of malaise'
Area of Effect  : Room
Aggressive      : Yes
Accumulative    : No
Duration        : Proficiency
Classes         : Monk           Level 60
===============================================
 
One of the monk's most devious chants, the sonata of malaise
invokes such a sense of anger and fear that it hampers the
monk's opponents movements such that they are less likely to
dodge certain spell effects.  This chant hurts all of the
victims' saves.

SONGS

Monks have a unique ability to aid them in their life.  These
special abilities are their chants, which enhance their abilities
and can give them an edge.  Monks can chant one of their songs
only once every 4 mud hours, and occasionally fail to properly 
sing the song.
A list of what a monk is capable of singing is listed by typing
songs.

SORCERER

   Sorcerers are dabblers in the arcane realms.  They reach into various
aspects of magic taking and leaving knowledge as they see fit, painting a
broad palette of spells for their personal use.  Some Sorcerers have been
known to forget specializing and after learning all they can go on to
learn an entirely different profession.

"SOUL TAP"

================================================
Usage         : cast 'soul tap' <victim>
Aggressive    : Yes
Type of spell : Sphere of Generic
Classes       : Necromancer
================================================
 
Like an advanced form of energy drain, this spell allows a
necromancer to leech energy from a living victim's very soul,
causing the victim significant anguish.  However, tapping
a soul has a prolonged enrichening effect, increasing the
user's ability to regenerate his or her own life energies for
some time.

SOULSHIELD

================================================
Usage	      : cast 'soulshield' <self>
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Protection
Classes	      : Anti-Paladin, Cleric, Diabolist,
	      : Paladin, Priest
================================================

For a wise and very devout cleric this spell, like its secular counter parts 
fireshield and coldshield, will reflect damage back upon an attacker.  This 
spell will only be affective upon foes of the cleric who are of opposite and
extreme alignment.  The foe will be burned for their lack of faith in the 
following of the gods of the righteous who are protected by a soulshield.

"SPEAK IN TONGUES"

================================================
Usage	      : cast 'speak in tongues' <self>
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Divination
Classes	      : Diabolist, Priest
================================================

This spell allows the caster to not only understand a language as it's spoken
but also to speak it fluidly as well.

SPELLBOOKS

Magic users need to write their spells down into their spellbooks in order 
to be able to use them. Spellbooks are for sale in shops dealing with
magical items. To write a spell in a spellbook, the scribe command must
be used.

Currently - (this is subject to change) For Sorcerer classes only 
(clerics get their spells from their gods) In order to memorize a
spell you must have a spellbook in your inventory with the spell in
question scribed into it.  To scribe a spell find a master (ie 
archmage) and rest. With a spellbook in one hand (purchased from
Bigby) and a quill in another (purchased from Aaron) type scribe
with no argument.  It will show how many spells are in your book and
which ones there are. If you are just starting your book will be
blank.  Type spells to see a list of spells you can scribe into your
book.  Scribe <spellname>.  Scribe is now a skill like kick or bash.
Your skill at scribe dictates how many pages in your spellbook the
spells you scribe will take up and as a result how long it would 
take to scribe your spells.  Scribing is no longer an instantaneous
process. When you have all your spells scribed save and hang on to 
those books.  If you lose them or part with them for any reason
you will be a weakling mortal walking around helplessly. Enjoy hot
death.

SPHERE

Spell spheres are skills for casting classes.  They advance as any other
skill might, when a spell of that type is used.  Spell potency is related
to how practiced your skill in that spell's related sphere is.

SPLIT
 
Usage: split <amount to split> <coin_type>
 
Example: split 1 platinum 4 gold 16 silver 40 copper
         split 1000 copper
         split 20 platinum 400 gold
 
Split is used to split money among people in your group who are in the same
room as you.  If you are in a group with 4 other people, all of whom are in
the same room with you, and you type SPLIT 100 COPPER, you will give each of the
other 4 group members 20 coins each.  (100 coins is split 5 ways; you keep
your share and give everyone else their share).  If someone is in your group
but outside the room, they will miss out on their share.

SPRINGLEAP
 
================================================
Usage      : springleap <victim>
Aggressive : Yes
Classes    : Monk           Level 50
================================================
 
With proper training in martial arts, skilled monks learn to channel
their muscle power into their legs, and leap from a sitting position
into their opponent, potentially knocking the victim over for a
short amount of time, an effect similar to a bash.  Failure may result
in the monk springing over the target or being knocked back.

STAT

Usage: stat [player | object | mobile | file] <name>

Gives information about players, monsters, and objects in the game.  The type
argument is optional.

   STAT PLAYER will search only for players; useful for statting people
   with names such as Red or Cityguard.

   STAT OBJECT will search only for objects.

   STAT MOBILE will search only for monsters.

   STAT FILE is used to stat players who are not logged in; the
   information displayed comes from the playerfile.

STEAL

Usage: steal <item> <victim>

Use steal to steal gold or items from people.  The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

See Also: PKILL, HIDE, SNEAK
#0
STEALTH

Usage: sneak

Especially sneaky rogues and thieves learn how to cover up their
tracks, making it difficult or impossible for would-be aggressors to
track or locate them.  When in stealth, users will also be invisible
to 'who -z'.  The stealth skill is initiated using the sneak command,
and is only successful when sneak succeeds.  The user will receive no
indication on the specific success of the stealth skill, however.

"STONE SKIN"

===================================================
Usage	      : cast 'stone skin' <victim>
Area of effect: <victim>
Aggressive    : No
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Protection
Classes	      : Necromancer, Cryomancer,
	      : Pyromancer, Sorcerer
===================================================

Stone skin when cast upon a victim will greatly assist that persons fight
survivability.  Stone skin will lessen the likelihood of that person being
hit during a battle, and if they are hit the damage is minimized.  The spell
is not perfect though and beings that are very powerful can strike through it
on occasion.

See Also: HASTE, MEMORIZE
#0
STOW

Usage: stow <item> <container>
       stow <item>

Drawing from their skill in concealing items, a thief may place an
object in a container or the room, hiding the action from others in the
room, even if they can see the thief.  Only one item may be stowed at
a time.  Upon failure, onlookers will become aware of the action and
the attempt at subterfuge.  Success depends on the user's skill in
conceal, the item's weight, the user's dexterity, and the item level
versus the skill user's level.

STRENGTH
 
Strength is the name of both an attribute and a spell.  The help file for
the spell follows the attribute's.
 
Strength is a measure of your raw muscle power.  It determines the
amount of weight you can carry and how heavy a weapon you can wield.
On the battlefield, strength plays even more important roles,
helping to decide in melee combat whether you hit or miss (your
to-hit) and how much damage you cause when you do hit.
 
Strength's effect on your to-hit chance is similar to hitroll or
wisdom, giving you an advantage when fighting similarly-leveled
opponents, but greatly dwarfed by the effect of your level's THAC0.
That means that no matter how much strength and hitroll you have,
you still won't be able to hit an enemy 25 levels above you.
 
The effect of strength on the amount of damage you do can be more
obvious than its effect on your to-hit.  Every few points of strength
will translate into an extra point of damage per hit.  This is
actually the reason that stronger races such as Barbarians and Ogres
do more damage--their true strength values are much higher than the
other races'.
 
===================================================
Usage         : cast 'strength' <victim>
Area of affect: <victim>
Accumulative  : Yes
Aggressive    : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Enchantment

              : Pyromancer      Circle 2
              : Sorcerer        Circle 2
===================================================
 
Young mages learn very early on magical methods of enchanting more
physical strength into themselves and others. This is probably done
out of a life long envy of the warrior types and their ease of
attracting wenches with their muscular physiques.

SUBCLASS_CLERIC SUBCLASS_PRIEST SUBCLASS_DIABOLIST SUBCLASS_DRUID

Clerics may choose one of the following subclasses, but they must do so by
level 35 or remain a cleric.  The questmasters for these subclasses are
scattered across the realm, though they are generally found where one
would expect.

Priest:         Clerics of good must triumph over the curses of evil, their
                subclasser can be found where there is purity and clarity of
                thought.

Diabolist:      The wicked must fight with evil against good, their subclasser
                can be found among those who worship the wicked Deities in one
                of the more demonic centers of worship in the realm.

Druid:          Clerics of the forests shall take on their skills and spells
                from one who also is one with the forests, within a similar,
                beautiful setting, deeply held within the high forests where
                one might find druid.

SUBCLASS_ROGUE SUBCLASS_ASSASSIN SUBCLASS_MERCENARY SUBCLASS_THIEF

Rogues may specialize into one of the following subclasses, provided they
do so by level 25.  They must seek out the questmaster to do so.  It is
rumored that this questmaster resides in a city of dwarves.

Assassin:       Those who wish to be trained killers may find their subclasser
                up where such people are tolerated, but failure could be
                costly.

Mercenary:      Thug-for-hire training can also be sought where such activity
                is tolerated, and not where the good or the realm wander

Thief:          Thieves can learn to steal the same place assassins first learn
                their killing arts.  Some places tolerate those activities 
                better.

SUBCLASS_SORCERER SUBCLASS_CRYOMANCER SUBCLASS_PYROMANCER SUBCLASS_NECROMANCER

Sorcerers who wish to specialize may choose from the following subclasses.
They must choose a specialty by level 45.  There is a questmaster for each
subclass located somewhere in the world, who must be found and obeyed by
the sorcerer wishing to subclass.

Cryomancer:     Cryomancers, mages of cold and ice, can be trained among the
                best in the realm.  The master they must train under lives 
                where life is comfortably cold, and elevated in the air by a
                mighty land formation.
        

Necromancer:    The wicked must fight with evil against good, their subclasser
                can be found among those who worship the wicked Deities in one
                of the more demonic centers of worship in the realm.

Pyromancer:     Pyromancers, mages of fire, can be trained in their arcane 
                arts by one who resides in a place where a mage of fire would
                be nice and toasty without having to keep himself so, probably
                below ground.

Warriors may choose from four subclasses.  They must choose a subclass by
level 25 or remain a warrior forever.  There is a questmaster for each
subclass, who must be sought out by the warrior who wishes to specialize.

Paladin:        Fighters of good must triumph over the curses of evil, their
                subclasser can be found where there is purity and clarity of 
                thought.

Antipaladin:    The wicked must fight with evil against good, their subclasser
                can be found among those who worship the wicked Deities in one

Monks:          Monks, being one of mind and body, and strong and hard of body
                as well, must find their subclass master in yet another temple,
                this one neither strictly associated with good or evil.

Ranger:         Fighters of the forests shall take on their skills and spells
                from one of their kind within a similar, beautiful setting,
                deeply held within the high forests where one might find a

              : Priest
========================================

Will summon a person of the name spoken. That is if they don't save the
spell and they are close enough to you. There is a quite nasty draw back
that can happen on a failed summon.  If you summon a creature without

Type of spell : Sphere of Summoning
Classes	      : Conjurer
================================================

Conjurers, as their primary spell, can summon elementals from the different
planes.  The exact plane of summoning is imprecise so a variance of elementals
is called upon to serve their magic master.  Periodically though as a conjurer
summons his minions one will arrive that is beyond the control of the master.
When this happens it will attack the master and anyone else in the vicinity
until such time that it dissipates and returns to its realm.

kill, as well as for some aggressive skills, including kick, peck, and
claw.

summoning to move themselves a short distance in any location.  This will
prove to be a lifesaver or certain death as the location of the outcome
is purely random in the local vicinity.

THAC0

THAC0 is an acronym for "To Hit Armor Class 0."  THAC0 is a number
every player and monster has, and it is dependent on level and class.
It is ranged between 0 and 20.  THAC0 is the method that the MUD code
uses to determine whether or not you have successfully "hit" an
opponent while in battle.  It is calculated for everyone fighting, for
each and every combat round.  For THAC0's, the lower the number you
have, the better success you will have at hitting.

For example:  let's say your THAC0 is 10, meaning you have to roll between
10 and 20 on a 20-sided die in order to hit an enemy with an armor class
of 0.  If you are fighting a monster with an armor class of 1, then you
need to roll between 11 and 20 to hit that mob.  If the mob's armor class
is 8, you only need to roll between 2 and 20 in order to hit that monster. 
You can affect your THAC0 by using magical items that give a positive
hitroll bonus.  This bonus will enhance your THAC0 and therefore your
ability to hit a monster.

THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

THIEF THIEVES
 
   Thieves are rogues who take special delight in relieving others of their
precious belongings.  Caring nothing for hard earned rewards, they take what
they want when they want it.  Having no real sense of morals, Thieves will
resort to dirty tricks of all kinds when cornered in combat, and know where
to stick their foes to do the most damage.  Thieves are adept at the
surreptitious manipulation of objects, and they tend to have an encyclopedic
knowledge of the loot to be found across the realm.

 
Primary attributes:  Dexterity
Allowed races:       Human, Half-elf, Dwarf, Duergar, Orc, Halfling
 
   *Note: Thief is a subclass of Rogue and, as with all other
          subclasses, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
          degree of experience and locating the subclass guildmaster.
 
Thieves are adept at identifying objects, and can usually learn all they
need without resorting to magic.

"THROAT CUT"
 
================================================
Usage      : throatcut <victim>

Classes    : Assassin       Level 31
================================================
 
Assassins that have gain sufficient experience in their deadly arts may
put their stealth techniques to use in an attempt to strike at their target.
The assassin will attempt to sneak up behind their victim and slit their
throat with weapon.
 
Damage done is based on a percentage of the victims maximum HP and can do
upwards of 99% although a penalty to exp gained accompanies this leathal
strike.

TIME

Usage: time

Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.

TITLE

Titles have been discarded in favor of the more RP concept of last names.
After reaching a suitable level of experience (level 20), a player may  
request a deity to set a last name. The name must be appropriate to class
and race, and no plagiarism will be allowed.

TRANSFER
Quasi-Deities.

Usage: TRANSFER <victim> [<target>]

Transfer is used to move a player or mob from one place to another.
The optional parameter, target, can be either the name of a player
or mob or it can be a virtual room number (like 3054, the reception).

If you do not specify the target, the victim will be transferred
to the room you are currently in.

TROLLS "SWAMP TROLLS"
 
Horrid carnivores, swamp trolls make their lairs around dense and murky
bogwaters.  Though their frame appears thin and frail, they possess
surprising strength in their long and ungainly arms.  The troll's rubbery,
moss green to putrid gray hide blends well with their natural
habitat. Preying on all but the most powerful of creatures, swamp trolls
know no fear and attack unceasingly with their sharp claws and jagged bite.

Since killing the same mob over and over can get really dull and a lot
simpler as we get used to it, you get less experience if you repeatedly
kill the same mob. The number of times you have killed a certain mob can
be viewed by the command "Trophy" 

You will get experience for the first few; however, this will decrease
after a number of kills.

However the TROPHY list is a fixed length (currently).
<>:<> trophy
 
Your Trophy List Is:

Kills       Mobiles
  2.00     the familiar
  1.00     the cute rabbit
  2.00     the fallow deer
  1.00     the brown fox
  4.00     the Large Worm
  8.00     the Lesser Shade
  4.00     the Large Shade
  6.00     the Skeleton
  0.33     the evil high priest
  2.33     the Larva Worm
  0.67     the Larva Worm
  3.00     a small iguana
  3.00     the fire ant
  1.00     the majestic praying mantis
  4.00     the large brown beetle
  3.00     the cute young ladybug
  2.00     the striped beetle
  5.00     the small firefly
  7.00     the small green beetle
  1.00     the huge black spider
  1.00     the army ant

In this example the player has visited several newbie areas about Mielikki.
There is an army any at the bottom of this players list.  If this player
decides to assist something else other than on this list meet its doom then
the army ant will scroll off the bottom and the player will get full exp
the next time he squashes an ant.  The ant will also appear at the top of
the list.

"UNHOLY WORD"

================================================
Usage	      : cast 'unholy word'
Area of effect: <room>
Aggressive    : Yes
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Death
Classes	      : Anti-Paladin, Cleric, Diabolist
================================================

Those who fight for the side of night can eventually be granted a very powerful
unholy power to speak a single word that good beings take such offense to that
it will actually cause them significant damage.  Those good beings who react to
this righteous word in a particularly poor manner have a chance to actually go
blind or become paralyzed.  This spell resembles dispel good with an area
effect nature.

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Usage: use <staff>
       use <wand> <Target>

Using a staff will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, except yourself.  Therefore staffs are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staffs and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use!  (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

hostname.

The following switches are available:

-p         Show only sockets in the playing sockets.
-d         Show only non-playing (deadweight) sockets.
-l min-max Show only sockets whose characters are from level min to max.

"VAMPIRIC TOUCH" "VAMPYRIC TOUCH"
 
Class: Anti-Paladin
Level: 45
 
Usage:
Vampiric touch is used by the Anti-Paladin to suck the very life-essence
out of his foes.  In order to successfully use vampiric touch, the Anti
must engage in direct physical combat with his enemy.  This means that
if either fighter is using a weapon, vampiric touch will fail.
 
Vampiric touch has also been known to work in tandem with the Anti's
damage spells, though this is not always successful.  Vampiric touch
stacks with LAYHANDS.

Area of effect: Self only
Type of spell : Sphere of Protection
Classes       : Cryomancer     Circle 13
================================================

Only the most skilled Cryomancers can use this spell to vaporize their own
bodies into magically-bound clouds of gas.  In this state, they become
extremely difficult to hit, as many attacks simply pass through their
bodies.  Vaporform is a high-level quest spell, and as such may only be
attained via a deity quest.

VITEM

Usage: vitem <type> [<field> <query>] [[from] <start vnum> [to] <end vnum>]]
 
List items of the given type.  The field, query, and vnum range parameters
work exactly like vsearch.  This allows you an extra degree of control over
plain osearch when searching for objects.  Type vitem without parameters
for a list of object types.
 
> vitem light
(get a list of all lights in the game)
 
> vitem potion level gt 50
(show potions above level 50)
 
> vitem weapon weight bt 5 and 10 from 30
(show weapons that weigh between 5 and 10 pounds from Mielikki)
 
> vitem scroll casts 'word of recall'
(list scrolls that cast word of recall)
 
> vitem scroll fillingness 5
(gives you an error because scrolls are not edible)

VLIST OLIST MLIST RLIST SLIST TLIST
 
Usage: olist
       olist <zone vnum>
       olist [from] <beginning vnum> [to] <end vnum>
       olist *
 
These commands all work the same.  They will give you a list of objects,
mobiles, rooms, shops, or triggers.  The default is to give you a list of
such items in the zone that you're currently in.  If you provide a single
number, it's taken as a zone, and all items in that zone are listed.
Two numbers will get you a list of all items between them (inclusive).
 
"olist *" will get you a list of every object prototype in the game.
This is not generally recommended, except perhaps with shops.
 
The olist, mlist, rlist, and tlist commands are actually convenience
aliases for the vlist command.  Typing "olist" has the exact same effect
as "vlist obj".
 
Examples:
   > mlist 0 200
   (display all mobile prototypes with vnums from 0 to 200)
 
   > tlist 30
   (display all triggers in zone 30)
 
   > olist
   (display all object prototypes in the current zone)
 
   > slist *
   (display all shops in the game)

VNUM MNUM ONUM RNUM SNUM TNUM ZNUM
 
Usage: vnum <type> <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       mnum <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       onum <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       rnum <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       snum <name>
       tnum <name> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] <end_vnum>]
       znum <name>
 
Identify items by name.  These commands can be used to find mobiles, objects,
rooms, shops, triggers, or zones whose names contain specific word.  For
example:
 
> onum sword
(a list of objects called "sword" is shown)

> znum sea
(zones with the word sea in their title are listed)
 
The mnum, onum, rnum, and tnum commands all use the vnum command structure,
which allows an optional set of parameters at the end of the command to
restrict your search to a certain block of vnums, or a specific zone.  (The
words "to" and "from" are optional.)
 
> onum bottle 30
(show bottles from Mielikki)
 
> rnum Beggar's from 6000 to 6299
(show rooms with vnums between 6000 and 6299 with "Beggar's" in the title)

VSEARCH MSEARCH OSEARCH RSEARCH SSEARCH TSEARCH VFIND MFIND OFIND RFIND SFIND TFIND
 
Usage: vsearch <type> <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       vfind <type> <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       msearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       osearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       rsearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       ssearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
       tsearch <field> <query> [[from] <start_vnum> [to] [<end_vnum>]]
 
These commands will display entities of a given type based on a search query.
These entities may be one of five types: mobiles, objects, rooms, shops, and
triggers.  The field parameter determines the aspect you are searching on, for
instance "name" or "cost".  Each of the five types have different fields
available, listed below.  The query parameter describes the search to be
conducted.  This query could be a single word, for name searches, or a number
range, for cost searches.  The last set of parameters is optional, and allows
you to restrict your search to a certain block of vnums, or a specific zone.
The word "to" is always optional, and "from" is sometimes optional.  (Under
certain circumstances if "from" is omitted, vsearch will think the start
vnum is part of the search query.)
 
Each search type has a list of possible fields to search on, and each field
belongs to a "domain"--a loosely-defined set of possible values for the query
parameter.  For instance, mobile hitpoints belong to the number domain: they
could be "45" or "32000", but never "sword".  While you do not actually need
to know about domains to use the vsearch command, knowledge of each domain's
allowed values will be useful in building proper vsearch queries.  See the
VSEARCH DOMAINS help file for more information.
 
Following is a list of possible search fields for each entity type.

"VSEARCH DOMAINS" VSEARCH_DOMAINS
 
Vsearch supports eight hard-coded field domains.  Each one allows you to
construct a query in a different way.  Although you are not required to
understand vsearch domains, knowledge of them will enable you to write
more powerful vsearch queries.
 
&8NUMBER&0

The number domain basically lets you supply a number as a search query
parameter.  However, it also allows you to enter ranges.  For the search
fields in the number domain, the following query syntaxes are supported:
 
    [equals | is] <number>
    {ne | not} <number>
    gt <number>
    lt <number>
    ge <number>
    le <number>
    {between | bt} <lower bound> [and] <upper bound>
    zone <zone number>
 
Supplying just a number is the same as explicitly specifying "equals",
which returns entities where the field has the exact value of the search
query.  Specifying a query such as "gt" though, will return all entities
with a field value greater than the one given in the search query.  For
example,
 
    vsearch mobile hitpoints gt 500
 
will give you all mobiles with (average) hitpoints greater than 500.  The
"between" query lets you specify two bounds, and return all entites between
those two.  The "zone" query type is designed to be used with number fields
like room exit (but can be used with any number field).  It allows you to
specify a zone number, and a between query will automatically be generated
with the lower and upper bounds as the bottom and top vnums for that zone.
 
&8STRING&0
 
The string domain actually just takes a single word for the search query.
Any following words will probably be ignored.
 
&8TYPE&0
 
This search query domain refers to fields where there are a preset list of
possible string values, such as class or gender.  Only one word of the
search query is interpreted as the type string.  Attempting to specify an
invalid type will result in an error; for example, trying to search for
mobiles of class "foobar" won't work.  Abbreviations of types are allowed.
 
&8FLAGS&0
 
This search query domain allows searching on bitfields, like spell or mob
flags.  You can specify a list of as many flags as you want, but they must
all be valid flags, or an error will be thrown.  For example, to find all
mobiles who have perma haste, blur, and stone skin, you would type
 
    vsearch mobile aff haste blur stone
 
The list will be terminated if it encounters the word "from", which is used
to signify the start of vnum bound parameters.
 
&8SPELL&0
 
This search query domain requires you to enter a valid spell name (skill
and chant names are also accepted).  The spell name can optionall be
enclosed in single quotes, unless it is a multi-word spell (such as word of
recall), in which case the quotes are required.  This search domain is used
by fields such as "casts":
 
    vsearch object casts 'word of recall'
 
would return all wands, scrolls, staves, and potions that cast word of
recall.
 
&8APPLY&0
 
The apply domain lets you enter an apply type (like strength, hit regen, or
damroll) followed by an optional numerical comparison, interpreted following
the number domain rules.  The following are all valid queries:
 
    vsearch object apply strength
    osearch apply hp ge 50
    osearch apply dr lt 0
 
The first query returns objects with any sort of strength apply, the second
returns objects with +50hp or more, and the third returns all objects with
-dr applies.  Only the 'object apply' field uses this domain.
 
&8TRIGGER TYPE&0
 
This is a special two-part type domain.  The first word is either mobile,
object, or room and the second is a list of trigger types (enter, greet,
etc.).  This lets you find, for example, all mobile triggers that are flagged
both GREET and RANDOM:
 
    vsearch trigger type mobile greet random
 
Only the 'trigger type' field uses this domain.
 
&8BOOLEAN&0
 
This domain accepts either a 'yes' or a 'no' value (though some other
equivalent values such as 'true' and 'false' are also accepted).  This domain
is used by fields like 'object poisoned'.

VSTAT

Usage: vstat < mob | obj > <virtual number>

Used to stat a prototypical mobile or object by virtual number.

Examples:

#100
VWEAR
 
Usage: vwear <position> [<field> <query>] [[from] <start vnum> [to] <end vnum>]]
 
List items that can be worn in the given position.  The field, query, and vnum
range parameters work exactly like vsearch.  This allows you an extra degree of
control over plain osearch when searching for objects.  Type vwear without
parameters for a list of object types.
 
> vwear head
(get a list of all headgear in the game)
 
> vwear 2hwield level gt 50
(show 2-hand wieldable items level 50 or above)
 
> vwear hold capacity between 10 and 20 from 30
(show containers, liquid containers, and fountains with capacities between
 10 and 20 units from Mielikki)

#100
WAKE SLEEPING REST SIT STAND

For changing your position.  If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea
to sit and rest for a while, or maybe even take a nap.

Note that you can engage in combat from most any position.  You can sit and
fight if you so choose and the game does not force you to stand. You must
manually type stand if that is your desire.

WISDOM
 
The wisdom attribute largely affects usage of skills.  Whether or not
your proficiency in a skill improves when you use it is decided solely
and equally by your wisdom and intelligence attributes.  The wisdom
attribute also affects your chance of success in various skills and
spells, namely conceal (and palm/stow) and animate dead.
 
Wisdom also has some influence in combat, helping determine whether
you hit an enemy in melee combat, but not to as great an extent as
strength and hitroll.
 
Wisdom affects spell saves, with an effect per point approximately
equivalent to the effect of a level.  For example, gaining 10 levels
would make you more difficult to hit with a spell.  Raising your
wisdom by 10 points would have the same effect.
