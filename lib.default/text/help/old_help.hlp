! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"

Examples:

  > tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
  No-one by that name here.

  > ^rasmusse^rasmussen
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

  > ^you^you doing^
  You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

AC

The lower your character's AC (acronym for "armor class"), the less
chance he or she will have of getting injured in battle.  Armor class
numbers often run into the negatives (good!) and it is not uncommon
for an extremely high-level player to have -100 AC.

Examples:
   100          Naked person
     0          Heavily armored
   -51          Very heavily armored
  -100          Nigh-unhittable


NOTE:  Within the mud code, armor classes are actually calculated on a
-10 to 10 scale.  Why?  Because THAC0's are calculated on a 0-20
scale, and thus must be equated against a -10 to 10 armor class scale
instead of a -100 to 100 scale.  What does this mean to you?  It means
that as far as the mud is concerned, if you have, for instance, a -55
armor class, you *really* only have a -50 armor class.  The values are
all rounded off to the closest ten.  So, when you are choosing your
equipment, disregard those few extra armor class points unless they
take you over the next 10th number value.

The help entry under THAC0 further explains this hit/miss system.

ADVANCE

Usage: advance <victim> <level>

ADVANCE moves a player to a new level.  If used to promote a player to an
immortal level, and if you have the autowiz program installed, the wizlist and
immlist will automatically be recreated.

Example:

  > advance rasmussen 34

ALERT

FieryMUD has multiple positions of resting. Although it's not fully implemented
you can be resting while standing.  When this happens you will be unable to do
many things, like move, participate in combat etc...  If you find yourself in
this odd state type alert to make yourself more alert.

#0
ALIAS ALIASES

Usage: alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias. This supports aliasing, not scripting entire routines.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell rasmussen $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

"ANIMATE DEAD"

===========================
Usage		: cast 'animate dead' <corpse/corpse name>
Area of effect	: corpses
Aggressive	: N/A
Accumulative  	: no
Duration	: random based on life of corpse
Type of spell 	: ??
Class	  	: Necromancer
===========================

Animate dead is a necromancers power base.  This is their initial master
spell.  Animate dead will bring undead of all many types into the realm
based on the necromancers level and the level of the former corpse.  If
a necromancer attempts to animate a creature significantly lower in level
than they are then they will be denied the undead.  The same applies for
animating significantly higher in level beings.  Necromancers use vast
amounts of concentration to maintain control over their undead minions.
As a result a necromancer can only control so many at once of varying
strength levels.  Some undead can be raised and free themselves from the
control of their master immediately turning on everyone in sight.  All
undead will eventually free themselves to wry havoc and chaos on areas in
the vicinity.  If you see a horde of undead without a master, just run.

ANON ANONYMOUS

This is a toggle that allows players level 50 and over to hide their 
class and level from view of the general population.  If someone is
anonymous then they have chosen not to show their skills to the world
at large.

ANSI COLOR

Usage: color [off | sparse | normal | complete]

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

  > color off
  This command disables all color.

  > color sparse
  > color normal
  > color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

'color' with no argument will display your current color level.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY slightly.
The effect is more noticeable on slower connections.  Even if you have
color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at all.

ANTIPALADIN ANTI-PALADIN

   Anti-Paladins are the essence of evil embodied.  These unholy warriors have
made dark pacts with the forces of Chaos and Destruction, which give them 
special powers.  Anti-Paladins seek the complete annihilation of good, and 
revel in pain, chaos, and destruction.  They have been known to be able to harm
with a simple touch, and fight with incredible bloodlust.  They are often seen
riding jet black unearthly mounts that resemble horses.  Anti-Paladins are 
granted the ability to sense good in the world around them and are granted a
degree of protection from it.

Primary Attributes:	Strength, Constitution, Wisdom
Allowed Races:		Human, Drow-Elf, Orc

   *Note:	Anti-Paladins are a sub-class of Warrior and, as with all
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

ASSASSINS

Assassins are trained killers, and while they may not be the strongest or
toughest of adversaries, their knowledge of anatomy, weapons, and poisons
makes them a feared hand of death in the realms.  Assassins are generally
evil, killing for their own gains, but some are even neutral and do it
only for the work, taking no special pleasure in death itself.  The
stealth of a trained assassin can make them seem to have faded from
reality completely, yet reappear behind you with daggers in hand, and all
without an ounce of magic. Assassins are known to be outlawed from entering
good aligned or lawful towns, villages, and enclaves.

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity
Allowed Races:		Human, Drow, Duergar, Orc

   *Note:	Assassins are a sub-class of Rogue and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

	  : Thieves
=========================================

A backstab is an attempt to sneak up on the victim and place a weapon
in the victim's back, at exactly the point where it will do the most
damage.  The amount of damage incurred is dependent on the proficiency
of the backstabber and the strength of the weapon.

You may only backstab with piercing weapons.  Assassins with good
enough proficiency at dual wielding weapons may double-backstab if
they wield two piercing weapons.

BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites.

Unban removes the ban.

Examples:

  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

BARDS
      This class has yet to be implemented.
   Bards are preformers of incredible skill, as well as con artists of equal 
skill.  Many bards are not as selfish as most rogues, preferring their musical 
craft over pick-pocketing.  Bards are often seen accompanying the forces
of good, lending their songs of courage and hope, and utilizing their abilities
to pick locks.  Some call bards hopeless romantics, caught up in their ballads,
but any bard will tell you differently, pointing out that not everyone cares
only for themselves.  The influence a bard has over others is truly amazing.
They have the ability to read a crowd and alter the emotions of that crowd.
Bards have been known, in fact, to boost the morale of soldiers to incredible 
heights, casting their own enchantment on those that hear their songs of
bravery, peace, love, and heroism.

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma
Allowed Races:		Human, Half-Elf

  *Note:	Bards are a sub-class of Rogue and, as with all other 
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

    You do the damage of a flaming claymore.

If a monk is holding or wielding anything in either hand then the barehand
advantage is negated and they will hit worse than sorcerers.

BASH

Classes	  : Anti-Paladin, Mercenary, Paladin, Ranger, Warrior

The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned.  To bash someone
is to attempt to 'knock' that person over.  If you succeed you will inflict
minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on it's rear. The victim will be
unable to issue any commands for a few rounds of combat. If you miss you loose
your balance and fall and suffer similar penalties from being in the prone
position.

A bash makes you unable to type commands for a few rounds of combat, including
fleeing.

Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict more damage.
A successful bash will stop someone from casting a spell.

BERSERKERS
	This class has not been implemented.
   Berserkers are warriors that have learned to harness their rage and call

BRIEF
Usage: toggle brief

Toggle "brief mode".  When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of
the room you are in; only the name of the room and the people and objects
there.  Unless you're very familiar with the area in which you're traveling,
however, it is not advisable to use this command.  Frequently, you will find
small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

If you explicitly type 'look', you will always see the full room description,
even in BRIEF mode.

BUILD BUILDING BUILDERS

        Once submitted, to FieryMUD or FieryWEB, any concept, 
        idea and the culmination thereof, refered to as work
        or material, becomes property of FieryMUD and will be
        used at sole discretion of the owner of FieryMUD in
        any way shape or form the owner finds appropriate.
        Submission of material or work requires reading of
        appropriate statements and instructions, of which
        this is, in advance of any submission.  Therefore
        submission of ideas or concepts is validation of 
        acceptance of this former implicit policy now 
        explicit.

Building here on Fiery is rather simple. To make it even easier, this help
file will give a few tips and rules that should be followed to make all the
zones on the MUD look uniform. More will be added as time goes on.

Rooms:
1) Always capitalize all important words in the room name.
Example: A Long Tunnel in Darkwood Forest
2) Always leave a three space indentation at the start of every room
description.

Objects:
1) An object's short description should never contain capitalized letters
unless they are proper nouns.
Example: a wicked mace named 'Bone Crusher' or an ivory handled dagger
2) Long descriptions should have the same structure as a proper sentence,
including first word capitalization and puncuation. Only proper nouns should
be capitalized in the long description.
3) An object should have on average an extra description of at least one or
two lines in length.
4) Try to keep objects balanced with the zone. Look at other zones or ask for
help if you are unsure of item balance.

Mobiles:
1) Mobile short descriptions should not contain any capitalized letters unless
they are proper nouns. No ansi code should be used before the first word of
their short description.
2) Mobile long descriptions should be structured like a proper sentence,
containing no capitalized words except for the first word and any proper
nouns.
3) Mobiles should not have unrealistic flags or levels. No level 50 fleas
or baby orcs with haste and stoneskin please.

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Alex Fletcher (Furry), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, and David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- And, of course, Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

CLASS SUB-CLASS CLASSES SUBCLASS SUB_CLASS

Fiery now offers a wide range of character classes and abilities, all of
which originate from five basic classes. Each of the basic classes have
extraordinary growth potential throughout gameplay. As you begin your
journey, you are limited to only these five classes. As you play and
experience new areas and levels, you are faced with a decision
to either specialize in a subclass, or retain your original class. If you
choose to specialize, your abilities and powers will expand accordingly,
leading the way to very powerful characters.

However, you may wish to remain a basic class. A basic class is not empty
by far, and though it has no advantages that some of the sub_classes offer,
it also has no disabilities or drawbacks.  Once you choose a sub_class you 
can not look back. You can not combine sub_classes; you can only choose one.
And when you do choose, your current skills/spells may change to reflect
your choice. If you choose to become a Cryomancer, you will cast down
the spells of a basic sorcerer to embrace the art of Cryomancing. These
sub_classes are obtained, if you so choose, by first becoming the proper
level. The proper level is found within the game. The actual choice will
be made by finding the(a) master of the sub class to teach you. The Master
may ask you to prove your worthiness of the class. Think hard on your
choice.

Type subclass to get a list of available sub_classes for your race.

You can not SUBCLASS until level 10.

If you are a warrior you must sub by level 15 or never.
If you are a cleric you must sub by level 25 or never.
If you are a sorcerer you must sub by level 40 or never.
If you are a rogue you must sub by level 15 or never.
As of now, none of the subclass quests are in the game
therfore if you want to sub just ask a god.
The classes of Illusionist, Hunter and Mystic no longer
exist, do not ask to sub to them.  The classes of Bard
Berserker and Conjurer have not really been implemented
do not ask to sub to them..

CONJURER

This class is unavailable pending completion.

Conjurers are mages that have concentrated on the essence of creation. 
These mages can take raw ethereal power and transform it into material
substances.  Conjurers have even been known to infuse material items and
beings with magical power and enchantments.  Unlike Illusionists,
conjurers practice true creation instead of perceived creation, which
gives them higher stability, but a limited range of effects.  Some of the
greatest monsters and magical items written of in all the lore of the
world were created by Conjurers. 

Primary Attributes:	Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Grey-Elf, Gnome, Drow, Orc, Half-Elf, Halfling

   *Note:	Conjurers are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

CONSIDER

Usage: consider <victim>

Consider is used to compare your groups strength in battle versus that of
a potential foe. You will receive a message indicating a rough estimate,
which is by no means exact, of your groups chances.  Consider does
not take hitpoints/special attacks/damage into account.  Nor does it consider
racial differences currently, just understand a mid level dragon will be a bit
more difficult than a mid level guard.

Example:

  > consider guard
Now where did that chicken go?

This message is for a group. So if you are a magic user don't think you can
solo this guy.

CRYOMANCER

Cryomancers are mages that have melded the essence of water with their
own powers, giving them incredible influence over the primal element of
water.  The element of water is mainly associated with emotions and
transformation.  These mages use water in its frozen aspect to shred any
who oppose them.  From turning the ground beneath their foes to ice, mud,
or even a flood up to encasing them in solid ice, a cryomancer is surely
not one to mess with.  Cryomancers have been seen walking upon the surface
of water as well as walking beneath it with no want of air.  They are seen
as ambassadors to the material plane from the plane of water, and have no
problems with any other elementalists, but harbor no love for fire
elementalists. 

Primary Attributes:	Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Grey-Elf, Gnome, Drow, Orc, Half-Elf, Halfling

   *Note:	Cryomancers are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

themselves at the main menu, or connections sitting in the "Get name"
state.

DEATH DIEING DYING

Well, if your hitpoints make it to -10 you DIE like the dogs you are. What
does this mean to you?  You will loose approximately 20 percent of the exp
you needed to get to what would have been your next level at time of death.
If you die and loose enough exp you can loose your current level and access
to any spells or skills gained at that level.  Loosing level is bad news.
I would suggest game play practices that avoid it.  A corpse is generated
of your former self when you fall to the ground dead.  This corpse will be
located where you died and will contain all the possessions you had on your
body at time of death.  To get your possessions back you will need to go to
your corpse and loot it. When you die you will reenter the game at your
point of sanctuary, whatever that point that is, and be severly wounded.

DEITY RELIGION

THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!

Each character on Fiery must select a deity at creation.  Some characters
will go on to be some type of religious class, such as cleric or shaman. 
These classes rely on their deity to grow in power, and to gain new spells
and skills.  The different deities represented on Fiery control various
spheres of influence, such as a particular race, or type of magic.  Each
has unique power, and bestows benefits upon followers as they increase in
level.  This increase in level is a reflection that the character is
growing closer to the deity in the religious relationship.  

Each deity has a specific alignment range that followers must adhere to. 
In the case of alignment deviation, punishment is swift, and in most
cases, quite harsh. As religious characters grow in level, the chances of
divine intervention on their behalf is greatly increased.  Divine
intervention can be something as simple as smiting an opponent in battle,
or allowing your spells to be cast instantaneously during a combat, or
something as dramatic as an avatar joining your group to kill a religious
opponent.  

Currently all a character has to do in order to 'worship' a deity is
choose at character creation, and then maintain the appropriate alignment
throughout their adventures on Fiery.  As levels increase, benefits and
punishments are much more meaningful to the game world as a whole.

DELETED DELETION

Currently players can not delete themselves. There is no ETA on when this
functionality will return.

Idle players, those who rarely if ever logon after creation will be deleted
due to inactivity.  There is also a an inactivity time out on player files
for players of higher level.  Level 1 players have 4 weeks until deletion.
For each additional level you get 3 more days of idle time above that. So, 
a level 10 player...
                    30 days + (3days*10) = 60 days of time before deletion
due to being idle in the pfile.
a level 50 player...
		    30 days + (3days*50) = 180 days of time before deletion
due to being idle in the pfile.

We think this is more than fair and it will serve to mop up the pfile for
faster access by real players.

DIABOLIST

Diabolists are clerics that have followed the dark paths to the heart
of chaos. Their allegiance with the great powers of evil gives them
powers to summon demons and cause other great effects of chaos and
destruction. It has been said that the greatest Diabolists resemble the
demons thay have charge over.  It is also said to never trust the word of
a Diabolist, for they see life itself as a disease to be cut from the very
fabric of existance and will always turn on you.  Diabolists seek only to
plunge the world into chaos, and undo the creation of all good things. 

Primary Attributes:	Wisdom, Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Gnome, Drow, Duergar, Orc

   *Note:	Diabolists are a sub-class of Cleric and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

DRUID

Druids are clerics that have taken to the forces of nature as their
source of power.  Nature has an incredible influence over all things in
the world, and Druids are able to utilize that influence.  Druids tend not
to tangle in the ways of good or evil, but live solitary lives in their
forest homes.  Druids often cooperate with Rangers to the ends of
preserving nature, but do not follow them on their biased path.  Druids are
benevolent, and seek to aid all living things, and will leave well enough
alone as long as their forests aren't harmed.  However, harming the realm
of a Druid can cause the realm itself to raise up against you and will
surely be your demise. 

Primary Attributes:	Wisdom, Charisma
Allowed Races:		Humans, Grey-Elf, Half-Elf

   *Note:	Druids are a sub-class of Cleric and, as with all other 
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

GROUP

Usage: group [player]
       group all

NOTE: Group has changed from its familiar form! No longer must you form 
a group by grouping yourself. Instead, simply follow the new guidelines!

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you and has consented to you, to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be
shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of
the killing blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have
been participating in the fight. 

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected.  All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command.  The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all!  The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>".  The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

  Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

  Quifael : "follow dragon"
  Redferne: "follow dragon"
  (Dragon should be following no one but himself)
  Dragon  : "group dragon"
  Dragon  : "group redferne"
  Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

GUILD

The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and

may enter the building. Guilds are also the places where people come to
learn and practice the skills of their trade. Note that the Thieves Guild is
hidden somewhere in town. If you can't find it, you probably chose the

HUNTER

NOTE THIS CLASS HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE GAME

   Stalking their prey and closing in for the kill, hunters are in it purely
for the sport.  They have a sense of mastery over all forms of life, seeing
everything as a prey animal, and themselves as the predator.  Hunters have many
of the same skills as rangers, but are shunned by nature as wasteful killers.
Rangers and Druids harbor a particular hate toward Hunters.  Poaching in the
wildlands is a favorite pastime for hunters, and Druids and Rangers will stop
at nothing to eradicate any hunter within their realm.  Hunters, on the other 
hand, see Rangers and Druids as excellent prey, and choose to stalk them over
any other animals they may find.

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Troll, Drow, Duergar, Orc

   *Note:	Hunters are a sub-class of Rogue and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved sfter reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

ILLUSIONIST
		REMOVED FROM THE GAME
   Illusionists are mages that have concentrated on the ability to alter
perception, and fool the weak of mind.  They understand all too well that seeing 
is believing, and can create an incredible array of effects ranging through all
the five senses.  Illusionists have been known to raze entire cities to the
ground, and leave the illusion of ruins, only to have the city evacuated and
overtaken without a single bit of damage.  The influence these mages have over
the weak minded often makes them seem as gods, but only to those that don't 
understand their power.

Primary Attributes:	Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Grey-Elf, Gnome, Drow, Orc, Half-Elf, Halfling

   *Note:	Illusionists are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

IMMORTALS IMMORTALITY 100

Immortals are people who have reached level 100. They should be respected
for having met and overcome the challenges of FieryMUD.

However, there are certain rules they must abide by:

0. They must not interfere with or hinder mortals.
1. That means no STAT'ing players or objects for mortals.
2. NO killing for mortals. Immortals cannot give away objects or equipment.
3. NO reimbursement for death traps or death, PERIOD.
4. NO experience reimbursement, PERIOD.
5. NO casting of spells on mortals for any reason, PERIOD.
6. Breaking any of these rules subject the immortal to immediate demotion.

Level 101's and above can do limited reimbursements for link problems
at their discretion.

Nobody likes rules, but we need them to keep the game fun and interesting.
The purpose of mudding is to overcome the challange. We wouldn't dare deprive
you of that by assisting you in any way that would cause you to avoid such
challanges inherent in the game. :)

LAG LINKDEATH CRASH CRASHES RESET RESETS REIMBURSEMENT

This information will try and provide you with information
about FieryMUD's policies on LinkDeath, Lag, Crashes and Resets.

LAG - LAG is an extended period of time when "nothing happens" on the
MUD.  Lag is 99.9% of the time caused by YOUR Internet Provider.
FieryMUD is running on a nice fast new machine with an Internet connection
with tons of bandwidth.  We do not reimburse if you LinkDie because  
of severe lag caused by anything other than FieryMUD's own resources.   

LinkDeath - Occurs when a player is inactive for a long period of time.
If you LinkDie, you will drop all of your equipment and coins where
you were standing.  When you re-enter the game you will be at
The Forest Temple of Mielikki.  You will generally not be reimbursed for
LinkDeath unless it is deemed FieryMUD's fault, even then it is upto the
discretion of the FieryMUD Gods.
 
Crashes - Crashes happen for various reasons and cannot be controlled.
You may think that since crashes are caused by FieryMUD that you can
get a reimbursement.  If there is a crash and you lose something
(You DID remember to SAVE right?) it is up to the discretion of the gods
wheter a reimbursement is possible in your case.

Resets - Resets happen on purpose.  There are an EXTREMELY few occourences
of resets.  If they happen you will be given time to rent.  If not
you will most likely be forced to rent by a God anyway.  If by chance
a reset occours and you do lose something, talk to a God a reimbursement
may be in order.

LAWS RULES SLAYER
       
Note this statement. It is an overriding statement of policy about
Fiery's Laws and Rules. Just because you can do something that will  
let you get around the spirit of the rules, that does NOT make it a 
legal action! Breaking the rules in spirit is the same as breaking
the rules period. Both will be treated the same.
 
Fiery's Laws

    I. No player killing or player stealing is allowed at this time.
       Assisting players in their demise will get you frozen and banned.

   II. Level 5 and below characters are off-limits at all times! They  
       cannot be attacked by other players until they are a bit more
       capable of defending themselves. After that, its up to the   
       player to be responsible for him/herself.

  III. Don't mess with the shopkeepers. Don't mess with the fountains.
       Such people/objects are life and death to new players. Messing
       with them is considered the same as messing with level 1 players.
       It WILL get you flagged. It may bring down even more serious   
       repurcussions.
       
   IV. Players should settle their own disputes.  Talking to a god 
       should be a last resort as gods must abide by very strict 
       non-interference policies on this mud.
       
    V. This is a game and it is meant to be a fair game. Exploiting
       bugs to build yourself an advantage is considered cheating here.
       Players should report all bugs as soon as they are discovered.  
       Using a bug for personal gain is cheating and will be dealt  
       with. Using a bug to harm other players is a vile crime and  
       will be dealt with by the gods in a very harsh fashion.

   VI. You may NEVER have more than 2 characters on at a time.. EVER! 
       Having more than 2 characters rented at a time is permitted. You
       are just not permitted to have more then two playing at once.
       Storage characters are not permitted either; they take up valuable
       space in the file system, slowing down file access for REAL players.
       
  VII. While it is certainly true that players are expected to fight  
       their own battles, this does not permit harrassment of any sort.
       Any form of harrassment will not be tolerated, whether it be  
       sexual or not. Immortality does not give one immunity to this
       rule either. People who harrass other players will be dealt
       with swiftly and firmly.

 VIII. No sharing of characters. No characters can be given away.

These laws are subject to change at any time without warning especially
as we're adding more and more features to the game or as new
situations arise. If you have a problem with excessing killing, talk
to a god. Like these laws? Hate them? Leave suggestions.

MAGIC MANA

Magic on Fiery can consist of either spells which a SORCERER type
inscribes into a SPELLBOOK, or else it can involve those abilities
which a god has given his or her favored worshipper, otherwise
known as cleric.

Fiery does not use mana, but a more D-n-D related CIRCLES system:
     spell circles          spell slots         spellbooks

Help files you may find useful concerning magic:
     cast      memorize     pray     forget     quick chant
     meditate

For more information on a given topic, type 'help <topic>'.

MEMORIZE

Usage: memorize <spellname>

Memorize allows a caster to have spells ready to use.  To be a
able to use a spell the caster must memorize the spell so 
that they may be able to cast it at a later time.
The memorization time of each spell depends on the spell level,
caster's intelligence, and caster's wisdom.

You must be resting to memorize.

Example:
If Harnak wanted to memorize magic missile, he would type:
memorize magic missile

This places the spell magic missile into a memorization queue.

typing memorize without argument might produce..

You have memorized the following spells: -
                                         | Spells already in memory and ready  
( 1st circle)    1 - minor creation      | to cast!
					 -
You are currently memorizing:            | 
    6 seconds: ( 1st) magic missile      | Spells placed into memory queue and
					 | either being memorized into memory
   6 seconds remaining			 | or awaiting memorization time.
					 -
You continue your studies.               | This person is actually memorizing
					 | and not just standing around.
					 -
You can memorize (1)1st circle spell(s)  | How many more spells of what circles
					 | can still be queued and memorized.
					 -

Clerics do not use memorize. Instead they pray for spells.

MERCENARY

Mercenaries are blades for hire.  They are a ruthless bunch that do nothing
without a price.  Physically stronger and tougher than most Rogues, Mercenaries
enjoy many of the abilities of Rogues with added combat skills like a warrior.
Often working as bounty hunters, they will capture and claim rewards.  Even if
their bounty is wanted for more alive, don't think they will hesitate to cut a
throat to make things easier.

Primary Attributes:	Strength, Constitution, Dexterity
Allowed Races:		Human, Dwarf, Troll, Drow, Duergar, Ogre, Orc, Barbarian

   *Note:	Mercenaries are a sub-class of Rogue and, as with all
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

"MINOR GLOBE"

Aggressive    : No
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Enchantment
Classes	      : Cryomancer, Pyromancer, Sorcerer
=================================================

A minor globe of invulnerability by name is somewhat deceptive, but then again
most of a sorcerer's early offensive ability is keyed off of striking fear into
potential foes.  The minor globe actually protects heavily against lower weaker
damage spells of all kinds. It has no defense for against more powerful spells.

"MINOR PARALYSIS"

=================================================
Usage	      : cas 'minor paralysis' <victim>
Aggressive    : Yes
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Enchantment
Classes	      : Cryomancer, Pyromancer, Sorcerer
=================================================

Minor Paralysis, when inflicted, causes the victim failing to save to become
paralyzed, unable to move or start combat, for a period of time.  Since the
spell is quite weak however, if attacked, melee will disrupt the holding
power of the spell causing it to dissipate.

MIRAGE

================================================
Usage	      : cast 'mirage' <self>
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Proficiency
Type of spell : Sphere of Protection
Classes	      : Pyromancer
================================================

Those magic users who are learing the ways of fire can learn a mothod of
surrounding themselves with an intense layer of heat.  This layer of heat
envelopes the pyromancer causing the waves of heat dissipating off the body
to mask the exact location of major body parts, making them seem to appear
slightly elsewhere.  This has the benefit of making the sorcerer of fire a
bit more difficult to actually hit.

MONK

Monks are Warriors that, like Mystics, have learned to harness their inner
powers to manipulate their own abilities.  Monks keep pretty much to 
themselves, practicing their combat routines and meditating.  They keep a
neutral outlook on the world around them, and generally don't get involved in
wars, politics, or other people's plans toward earthly gains.  Monks instead 
use their abilities to influence the world to increase harmony and balance.  
They view the forces of good in a much better light than those of evil, 
however, due to evil's blatant disregard for life and harmony. Monks will 
always be more than happy to free an enemy from their earthly form and free
them from their karmic mistakes.

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom
Allowed Races:		Human, Half-Elf

   *Note:	Monks are a sub-class of Warrior and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

MYSTIC

THIS CLASS HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM FIERY, DO NOT ASK ABOUT IT.

Mystics are clerics that seek the path of self enlightenment as opposed to 
worshipping a being that already has it.  Believing that they are all a thread
of the universal fabric, and are one with the gods, and everything else around
them, these great seekers of inner peace are able to pull and tug a few of the
threads while in this limited physical form.  Mystics spend much of their time
deep in meditation discovering the ways of the universe and discovering their
own abilities.

Primary Attributes:	Wisdom, Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Grey-Elf

   *Note:	Mystics are a sub-class of Cleric and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

NAME NAMES LASTNAMES

On FieryMUD your name is more than how your character is identified. Your
NAME is how you role play.  So, it is essential you choose a unique name.
You shouldn't use names from existing well known fantasy or lore.  I know
some really good names have already been used, and it can be possible that
a name you choose is used in some book you've never heard of but keep these
guidlines in mind.

Types and examples of unacceptable names are:
1) Compound words. Examples: LadyJade, BraveBlade, ImmortalSoul
   These types of names give a player an unearned arrogance above
   other players and in some instances above the gods.

2) Offensive words or names, mispelled or backwards. Eg: Sgurd Kcuf Emod

3) Names from known mythos, movies etc... Examples: Feyd, Conan, Zeus
   Come on, you can be more creative than reliance on an existing known
   character.

4) Names that do not fit the character you are playing. Examples:
     A human named Gruzel
     A troll named Bob
     A boy named Sue
     An orc named Ripenthiel

5) No offensive words or names from other languages or cultures.

6) No Nouns verbs or adverbs. Eg. Jester, Red, Dog, Bloody, Hotly, Freedom
   Pervert, PC, Trouble, McIntosh, Desperado.  Sorry guys LAME.

7) No names that resemble common nouns verbs or adverbs. Eg. Jesterx,
   Redx, Chamelion, Desperato etc...

8) No modern names. Examples: Rina John Mike Steve

We know names themselves constitute nouns, and if you want to be banned
very quickly take some time to point that out to us.
There have been many many names chosen on fiery in the last year that do
not meet these criteria, and luckily for us we have been able to prevent their
future use.  There are countless names that do meet this criteria however.

Does your name meet this criteria?

If you answer yes to this question and it's obvious that your name doesn't meet
the criteria, expect to be frozen outright and informed your name doesn't meet
the criteria.  Our nameing policy exists to encourage RP and avoid devolution
into the social smurf mush we almost were before.  Our policy isn't as hardcore
as I've seen some muds be.  For muds that have name standards we're actually
fairly slack.

Players may petition for an RP lastname at level 20.  Common or historical
lastnames will not be accepted.

Titles may be earned for certain feats of skill but they will be rare.

NECROMANCER

   Necromancers are mages that have concentrated on the magical aspects of
death.  They have the ability to slow down the process of decay in corpses,
then creating undead horrors from them.  This makes the necromancer a very
worthy adversary, being able to take the corpses of his foes and compelling
them into his service.  Great Necromancers have been known to rip the very
life essence from the bodies of their victims and cannibalize it to increase
their own power.

Primary Attributes:	Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Drow, Orc

   *Note:	Necromancers are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain

NEWBIE

Welcome to FieryMud! We hope you will check out these topics; they are of
special interest to new players.

First, beware of fighting in any towns. They are usually patrolled, and if
you are caught fighting, you will usually be eradicated. In other words, 
guards now usually assist ANY mob a player attacks within a town.

Second, locate newbie areas. Try to stay out of areas that are too high of
a level for you. If you die, you will end up at your race's start town,
but your corpse and all your money and gear will drop where you died and
you will need to go get it.

Stats of the game:
     99 mortal levels                 12 races, 4 class/20 subclasses

   Paladins are defenders of the weak and upholders of the faith.  They
are an elite group of warriors that have made alliances to the divine
powers of good and are granted special abilities from that alliance. 
Paladins are able to detect the presence of evil in the world around them
and are also granted a degree of protection from it.  Paladins have been
known to heal merely by touch, and are very quick to rescue those in
trouble.  Paladins are rarely seen without their mounts, which they have
an uncanny relationship with, often preferring the company of such a mount
to that of others.  Paladins value Order and Virtue, and strive to make
the world a place free of evil, chaos, and destruction. 

Primary Attributes:	Strength, Constitution, Wisdom
Allowed Races:		Human

   *Note:	Paladins are a sub-class of Warrior and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

PETITION

Usage: petition <message>

Allows a mortal to petition any or all administrators for assistance. 
Misuse of this command will get you in major trouble. If a god is
invisible, it's probably for a very good reason; if you annoy him/her
for something social or something that is not absolutely pressing, count
on problems.

Times to use petition:
    >petition err.. can I have a pardon? Pretty please? I'm sorry!
    >petition Azkrael asked to speak with me as soon as I got on.

Times not to use petition:
    >petition I found a typo!
    >petition Tell Gabnor I said hi! Is he around?
    >petition azkrael *whine* can I have a starsword?

You can not petition directly to one god. All gods online hear petitions
unless they decide to avoid them.

did what you told'em to do...

PRAY

Usage: pray <spell>

Pray is used by cleric types in much the same way memorize is. If you're
not a cleric type, then it's just a cute social.

Pray allows a cleric to have spells ready to use.  To be a
able to use a spell the cleric must pray the spell so 
that they may be able to cast it at a later time.
The pray time of each spell depends on the spell level,
caster's intelligence, and caster's wisdom.

You must be resting to pray.

Example:
If Kozir wanted to pray cure light, he would type:

pray cure light

This places the spell cure light into a memorization queue.

typing pray without argument might produce..

You have memorized the following spells: -
                                         | Spells already in memory and ready  
( 1st circle)    1 - instant death       | to cast!
					 -
You are currently praying:               | 
    6 seconds: ( 1st) cure light         | Spells placed into memory queue and
					 | either being memorized into memory
   6 seconds remaining			 | or awaiting memorization time.
					 -
You continue your studies.               | This person is actually memorizing
					 | and not just standing around.
					 -
You can memorize (1)1st circle spell(s)  | How many more spells of what circles
					 | can still be queued and memorized.

If the argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its

equipment will drop on the ground and the player will lose his/her

PYROMANCER

   Pyromancers are mages that have melded the essence of fire with their
own powers, giving them incredible influence over the prime element of
fire.  The element of fire is mainly associated with transmutation, and
these mages are more than willing to transform any transgressor into a
pile of ash.  Pyromancers have been known to summon great beings of living
flame to do their bidding, and also are seen as the ambassadors to the
material plane from the plane of fire.  Pyromancers dont have any problems
with any other elementalists, but harbor no love for water elementalists. 

Primary Attributes:	Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Grey-Elf, Gnome, Drow, Orc, Half-Elf, Halfling

   *Note:	Pyromancers are a sub-class of Sorcerer and, as with all

RACE RACES

A race is a sort of humanoid (though not always!) that possesses sentience
and can adventure in Fiery to gain exp and levels and neat stuff.
Available races on Fiery are currently orcs and humans, but as building
expands, this number will as well. Not all races can become all classes --
in fact, many are severely limited. You can type SUBCLASS to find out what
classes are available to the race you currently play. *the SUBCLASS command
is not yet implemented fully, but should be soon!

All races are currently allowed in code, but DO NOT ASK for one of them.

Eventually, races will include:
    Human         Grey Elf      Gnome           Mountain Dwarf
    Half-Elf      Halfling      Swamp Troll     Ogre     
    Duergar       Drow Elf      Orc             Barbarian

RACEWAR

One of Fiery's primary goals is to create a challenging, yet not
imbalanced, pk system that allows most players to go about their business
while allowing others the opportunity to engage their characters against
others'. To that end, we have created the racewar.

Any player may freely destroy another character (if she can), if that
other character is of a race coded as hostile to the player's. In other
words, orcs may freely attack elves, elves may attack orcs or dwarves,
trolls may attack halflings, etc. No race may kill its own.

Since most races will not mingle with others (it being difficult and
time-consuming to go far), and since the justice system employed by Fiery
punishes those who do attack other characters, this more or less ensures
that if someone does choose to pkill/psteal, she has given this matter
extensive thought and thoroughly developed her character.

RANGER

   Rangers, like Paladins, are warriors of Virtue, but seek the
preservation of nature.  They are good warriors opposed to the forces of
destruction and evil.  Rangers must stay in good graces with nature, and
if they fall into the ranks of evil, will lose all powers granted them
from nature.  Rangers have a relationship with animals that compares to
their relationship with people, and are able to make friends in the animal
kingdom easier than they do with other people.  Rangers are able to move
about outdoors with incredible stealth, and are able to detect the passage
of any being through any area. 

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence
Allowed Races:		Human, Grey-Elf, Half-Elf

SAVE

Usage: save

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

SAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT '

Usage: say | shout
       tell | whisper | ask <player> <string>

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

Examples:

  > say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:

  > ' hello there.

Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.
You must be level 2 before you can use shout.

Usage: score

Provides useful information on your status such as age, hit points,

SCRIBE

=======================================================================
Usage	  : scribe <spellname>
       	    -- where <spellname> is the complete name of the spell.  
Classes	  : Conjurer, Cryomancer, Necromancer, Pyromancer, Ranger,
		    Sorcerer
=======================================================================

   Scribe is used by sorcerors (and sub-classes) to keep a written copy of
each spell in their spellbook.  The spellbook is an intergral part of the
spell memorization process, and each spell must be scribed into a
spellbook before the sorceror can memorize the spell. 

To scribe a spell, the spellbook must be held, and a quill must be used.

NOTE- Abbreviations are accepted for spellname, however, since many spells
have similar abbreviations, they may conflict with what actually gets
written to the spellbook.

SEARCH

Usage: search

Allows you to find things that are hidden, like objects, creatures, 
or doors. At this time, must be used successfully in order to open
a secret door.

#0
SEDIT

Usage: sedit <shop's virtual number>

This will set up a new shop in OLC, or edit one already defined. SHOW
SHOPS will define what shops are already set up (Fiery convention dictates
that the vnum of the shop will be the same as its room vnum, to keep
things easier). 

To set up a shop, you need to have: the vnum of the shopkeeper, the vnum
of the shop's room(s), the vnums of all objects to be sold. You must also
define hours of operation (if desired) and buy/sell messages.

See also: SHOW, REDIT, MEDIT, OEDIT, ZEDIT, OLC, BUILDING
#100
SELL

Usage: sell [#] <item>
       sell <#>.<item>

If you'd like to sell an item to a shopkeeper, trying selling it to them.
Most shops specialize in what they will buy, so you may have to look around
to find a buyer for your items.
 
Examples:
 
  > sell sword       (sell the first sword in your inventory)
  > sell 3 sword     (sell the first three swords in your inventory)

For now, shopkeepers seem uninterested in buying anything, including
items they have sold. Hopefully they will be more interested in the
near future!

"SENSE LIFE"

==================================================
Usage	      : cast 'sense life' <self>
Accumulative  : No
Duration      : Dependent on proficiency of caster
Type of spell : Sphere of Divination
Classes       : Cleric, Diabolist, Priest, Ranger
==================================================

This spell will enable you to sense hidden life forms in a room.
Creatures affected by INVISIBILITY and/or HIDE (i.e., hiding) will
appear as definite lifeforms, although you will be unable to discern
their true nature.

See also: HIDE, INVISIBILITY
#0
SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

SHAMANS

   Shaman are the manipulators of the spirit realms, utilizing the spirits of
nature to accomplish many feats, these uncivilized work with the raw power
around them to harm, heal and manipulate.  Some Shaman forget choosing a Totem
and continue to dabble with the spirit world until they learn all they can and 
go on to learn an entirely different profession.

Allowed Races:		Troll, Ogre, Orc, Barbarian

No one seems sure what Shamans do. This is uncharted territory.

Druid innate skill. Will change you into either a mammal, bird, or
reptile, depending on proficiency with the skill and random chance.
You could turn into a sparrow, or a rhino, or a chameleon. Each

Type of spell : Sphere of Generic
Classes       : Conjurer, Cryomancer, Necromancer,
	      : Ranger, Sorcerer

The spellcaster attempts to grasp the enemy with a bare hand, but for
only the briefest of instants.  On contact, the target is blasted with
a searing shock of electricity, causing great pain.

SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his quests,
and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils
with his life and sanity intact.  Many shops trade only in a specific type of
merchandise.  Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if it is
of high quality!

Shopkeepers seem uninterested in all types of items for now. Hopefully, their
interest will be peaked in the future!

SHOW

Usage: show <mode> [argument]

Valid Modes:

player         rent           shops          stats
zones   

The SHOW command displays information.  Some modes of show require additional
information, such as a player name.

   death: Shows all death traps in the game.
  errors: Shows errant rooms.
godrooms: Shows the rooms in the 'god zone'.
  houses: Shows the houses that are currently defined.
  player: Shows player summary information, simply provide a player name.
    rent: Shows the filename and path to a players rent file.
   shops: Shows all the shops in the game and their buy/sell parameters.

#100
SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.

NOW        Just like reboot sept shutdown now will shutdown without saving
	   charaters or olc info.

SKILLS

A note about skills:  On FieryMUD you advance your skills by using them.

hundreds of times before any real advancement in the skill is noticed.

Usage: skills

A command that shows you all of the skills your character has access to,
and your proficiency levels. To get better at using your skills, you must
use them!

SLEEP

SLEEP is both a command and the name of a spell.

The SLEEP command puts you to sleep, allowing you to regain your health more
quickly.  You will be largely unaware of your surroundings while asleep.
You can awaken yourself with the WAKE command.

The SLEEP spell forces the victim into a magical sleep such that they cannot
be awakened until the spell wears off.

SNEAK

Classes: Assassin, Bard, Rogue, Thief

Used for sneaking (moving in and out of rooms without anyone taking notice).
When you type sneak, there is no way to know if you're actually sneaking.
If you successfully sneak, then you'll continue to sneak for a little while.

#0
SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command; 
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.

SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.

SOCIALS

Usage: <social> [<victim>]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action,
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on
the social.  (Slap a dragon lately?)

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

SPELL SPELLS "SPELL SLOT"

On Fiery we have cast off the idea of mana. Instead we use a AD-D type
of system in which a player must memorize/pray spells. These spells are
divided into different SPELL CIRCLES limiting the spells that a
caster/semi-caster can draw upon. At level 1 a caster is proficient in
one spell circle.
  (S)He is allotted 1 SPELL SLOT from that circle which he can
memorize/pray. As he gains in levels, the numbers of slots available in
each circle increases as does the number of circles in which the caster is
proficient.  The caster has available to him a number of spells at
each circle which he can memorize/pray.  (S)He simply chooses those spells
which he wishes to use and memorizes/prays for them.  The slots can
be used up on all different spells or all on the same spell or any
combination of spells.  These spells are then a part of the caster's
mind and can be called upon at any time.  Once a spell is cast it
s no longer memorized or prayed for.  It becomes a spell that needs
to be memorized again.  It cannot be cast again until it is re-memorized
or reprayed for.

SPELL_CIRCLE CIRCLE_SPELL

Those who cast spells by either memorizing them or from god granted abilities
will potentially gain spells every eight levels.  This will occur at the 
following intervals:

Circle: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13
Level:  1  9  17 25 33 41 49 57 65 73  81  89  97

Some classes may not get spells every circle, others may get an abundance. It
all depends on the interdependance of the class and how it integrates into the
class structure..

SPELLBOOKS

Magic users need to write their spells down into their spellbooks in order 
to be able to use them. Spellbooks are for sale in shops dealing with
magical items. To write a spell in a spellbook, the scribe command must
be used.

Currently - (this is subject to change) For Sorcererous classes only 
(clerics get their spells from their gods) In order to memorize a
spell you must have a spellbook in your inventory with the spell in
question scribed into it.  To scribe a spell find a master (ie 
archmage) and rest. With a spellbook in one hand (purchased from
Bigby) and a quill in another (purchased from Aaron) type scribe
with no argument.  It will show how many spells are in your book and
which ones there are. If you are just starting your book will be
blank.  Type spells to see a list of spells you can scribe into your
book.  Scribe <spellname>.  Scribe is now a skill like kick or bash.
Your skill at scribe dictates how many pages in your spellbook the
spells you scribe will take up and as a result how long it would 
take to scribe your spells.  Scribing is no longer an instantaneous
process. When you have all your spells scribed save and hang on to 
those books.  If you lose them or part with them for any reason
you will be a weakling mortal walking around helplessly. Enjoy hot
death.

other 4 group members 20 coins each.  (100 coins is split 5 ways; you keep

envy of the warrior types and their ease of attracting wenches with their
muscular physiques.

Conjurers, as their primary spell, can summon elementals from the different
planes.  The exact plane of summoning is imprecise so a variance of elementals
is called upon to serve their magic master.  Periodically though as a conjurer
summons his minions one will arrive that is beyond the control of the master.
When this happens it will attack the master and anyone else in the vicinity
until such time that it dissipates and returns to its realm.

THAC0

THAC0 is an acronym for "To Hit Armor Class 0."  THAC0 is a number
every player and monster has, and it is dependent on level and class.
It is ranged between 0 and 20.  THAC0 is the method that the MUD code
uses to determine whether or not you have successfully "hit" an
opponent while in battle.  It is calculated for everyone fighting, for
each and every combat round.  For THAC0's, the lower the number you
have, the better success you will have at hitting.

For example:  let's say your THAC0 is 10, meaning you have to roll between
10 and 20 on a 20-sided die in order to hit an enemy with an armor class
of 0.  If you are fighting a monster with an armor class of 1, then you
need to roll between 11 and 20 to hit that mob.  If the mob's armor class
is 8, you only need to roll between 2 and 20 in order to hit that monster. 
You can affect your THAC0 by using magical items that give a positive
hitroll bonus.  This bonus will enhance your THAC0 and therefore your
ability to hit a monster.

#100
THAW

Usage: freeze <victim>
       thaw <victim>

FREEZE, originally invented here at CircleMUD (we think), is used to prevent
a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will ignore all commands entered
by the player, including QUIT, until the player is unfrozen with THAW.

Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme disciplinary
circumstances.

THIEF THIEVES

   Thieves are rogues who take special delight in releaving others of their
precious belongings.  Caring nothing for hard earned rewards, they take what
they want when they want it.  Having no real sense of morals, Thieves will
resort to dirty tricks of all kinds when cornered in combat, and know where
to stick their foes to do the most damage.  It is a well known fact that a Thief
will not hesitate to kill to get what they want, so often just giving it up
can save you a lot of trouble, as well as your life.

Primary Attributes:	Dexterity
Allowed Races:		Human, Grey-Elf, Dwarf, Drow, Duergar, Orc, Halfling

   *Note:	Thieves are a sub-class of Rogue and, as with all other
		sub-classes, can only be achieved after reaching a certain
		degree of experience and locating the sub-class guildmaster.

TROPHY

Since killing the same mob over and over can get really dull and a lot
simpler as we get used to it, you get less experience if you repeatedly
kill the same mob. The number of times you have killed a certain mob can
be viewed by the command "Trophy" 

You will get experience for the first few; however, this will decrease
after a number of kills.

However the TROPHY list is a fixed length (currently).

Your Trophy List Is:

Kills       Mobiles
  2.00     the familiar
  1.00     the cute rabbit

  1.00     the brown fox

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Usage: use <staff>

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either a
character or an object.

Both staffs and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use!  (Use the
grab or hold commands).  You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

WAKE SLEEPING REST SIT STAND

For changing your position.  If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea
to sit and rest for a while, or maybe even take a nap.

Note that you can engage in combat from most any position.  You can sit and
fight if you so choose and the game does not force you to stand. You must
manually type stand if that is your desire.
