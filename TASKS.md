## Next Iteration Priorities

### 1. TLS/SSL Encryption Support 🔐 **[HIGH PRIORITY - Security]**

**Status**: Ready to implement  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 hours  
**Dependencies**: GMCP client detection (completed ✅)

**Immediate Security Need**: Modern MUD servers require encrypted connections for:
- Player password protection during login
- Protection against network eavesdropping
- Compliance with modern security standards
- Enhanced client trust and adoption

**Technical Implementation**:
- Integrate Asio SSL streams with existing PlayerConnection architecture
- Add certificate management (self-signed for development, CA-signed for production)
