flask stone stone-flask~
Unlike the standard wizard's flask, which is made of glass, this flask is
made of a heavy grey stone, making it difficult to see what is inside.~

stone-club~
It's a very heavy club made of granite or some other grey stone.  It would
probably be very effective as a weapon, if you are strong enough to wield it.~

stone-ring small-circular-rock questobject~
It's a circular piece of stone that could probably fit around a small finger.
It has a strange, unpolished part, though - maybe it was broken off of
something?~

grey-staff gray-staff stone~
It's a long grey staff.  Touching it, you can feel the chill of cold stone,
though it seems pretty light for something made of stone.  Maybe it's
enchanted.~

Oof!  How could anyone walk around in these things?  It looks like an ordinary
pair of leather boots, except that the boots are actually made of a dark grey
stone!  Maybe they were turned into stone by magic, because not even dwarves
wear stone boots.~

statue stone sorcerer~
This monolith is huge and towers to nearly the top
of the caverns. The sorcerer is in a battle pose
casting lightning in one hand and brandishing a
dagger of stone in the other. The sorcerer is
wearing a light battle robe and has an amulet
dangling on his chest.~
E
amulet chest~
On his chest is an amulet wit odd inscriptions.
It even seems to glow somewhat with a circular
pattern within as though it has had a piece
removed.....~
E
dagger~
The dagger looks crude but sharp none the
less. It also seems to glow with the
same energy as the lightning?~
