sickle shining gold-handled-sickle~
It is a small sickle made of shining gold.  Inscribed into the blade are the
holy symbols of the druidic order, and the shape of the whole sickle is of
course reminiscent of the crescent moon.  The golden sickle can be used as a
weapon in a pinch, but its primary function is as a ritual instrument for the
harvesting of mistletoe and other plants for ceremonial use.~

The chapter headings are:

chapter3 : The future~
E
chapter1~
This chapter is entitled 'The Cult of the Griffin' and it reads:

From time immemorable griffins have lived on this island, and also those who revere
them as powerful, supernatural creatures. The cult believe that Dagon is the god of
the griffins and chooses one griffin captain to lead the other griffins during
their time on the island.  The strength of the griffins is dependant on their
captain, if he dies then the power and influence of the griffins wanes until a
new captain is appointed by Dagon.  The cult also believe that if they can
summon Dagon to appear in mortal form, as the ultimate griffin captain he will
bring ultimate power to the griffins and hence their worshippers.  The cult
worship in a chapel which contains an altar that Dagon has invested with the
power to generate new griffins.  In olden times the chamber containing the
altar was linked via a large crystal to the surface where it drew power from
the sun.~
E
chapter2~
Earle

As long as there have been griffins on this island there have also been
druids, and as long as there have been druids, there has been Earle, the
eldest druid.
Earle defeated the last griffin captain who was named Arkranos and at the
same time broke the megalith which was the conduit for the power required
by the altar. He never actually destroyed the altar though, and so the
griffins continue to thrive and there is now a rumour that a new
captain has been appointed.
There is a rumour that when Earle started to fight Arkranos he realised that
he would need assistance to completely remove the threat of griffins from
the island because the holy oak there had been contaminated with the evil.
Stories tell of a weapon that was fashioned to kill Dagon and that the
unthinkable occurred when a cutting was taken from a holy oak to help restore
balance on the isle.
The items were sent but never received.~
E
chapter3~
The future

The seer has prophesied that the cult will finally discover the means to
allow Dagon to appear in mortal form, and that at this point they shall
understand his true nature and be destroyed.~

This pearl is like no other you have seen before.  Instead of being a circular

quite a bit larger than most pearls too.~
