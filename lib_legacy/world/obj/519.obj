academy-fountain dragon tree~
This fountain is quite the work of art, carved from solid marble.  Water from
some unknown source flows from the dragon's open mouth, pooling around the
roots of the carved tree, readily available for the students and faculty of
Ethilien Academy.  The water is sweet and clear, with no hint of brackish or
muddy pollution.~
