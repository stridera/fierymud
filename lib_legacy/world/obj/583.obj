satin dress~
This dress is made of fine satin; it's the color of orchids, with gold
braid accents and dark purple ribbon trim. The neckline seems a bit 
daring, but from the cut of the dress, you can tell that whoever wears 
this garment wouldn't be embarassed unduly by showing a bit of cleavage. ~

wedding gown dress~
You've never seen such a magnificent gown! It's good enough for a 
princess or queen to wear to her nuptials, with a long, flowing skirt
of white silk tulle, and a bodice of the same and covered in handmade 
laces from around the world. The leg-o-mutton sleeves end in triangles
of soft white fabric that partially cover the backs of the bride's hands. 
Truly, it's a magnificent garment.~

bridal bouquet~
The bouquet is made up of what must be a hundred absolutely perfect
roses. Most of them are cream colored, but there are a few golden 
ones thrown in to add artistic flavor. The bouquet is very large,
going down to the bride's knees, but it's so light that she could
carry it easily.~

This finely made mantle is made of dark green velvet, edged in thick

are an excellent foil for the velvet, which is brocaded in gold.~

This sheet seems a little threadbare, which is probably why it
isn't on somebody's bed. The little golden-and-green flowers
that adorn it are sprightly, although they detract from the
general image the wearer must be trying to project.~
