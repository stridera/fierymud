rune runes~
The runes are carved in a spidery script, reading:
if you are near to the dark
I will tell you 'bout the sun
you are here, no escape
from my visions of the world
you will cry all alone
but it does not mean a thing to me
knowing the song I will sing
till the darkness comes to sleep
come to me, I will tell
'bout the secret of the sun
it's in you, not in me
but it does not mean a thing to you
the sun is in your eyes
the sun is in your ears
I hope you see the sun
someday in the darkness.

hair lock brown dusty torowas-hair~
It shifts from left to right, always covering half the face.  It's a light
brown lock of hair, matching seamlessly the hair on the rest of the wearer's
head.  It almost, but not always, obscures an eye.  Despite this, it doesn't
seem like it impairs vision at all.  What is the purpose of such a strange
fashion statement?    ~

ring wedding-ring silver-leaves-ring ari-torowa-ring~
Beautiful and delicate, this priceless ring has a base of some soft green metal
which is overlaid with an incredibly realistic display of silver leaves.  Each
leaf is different, representing oack, ash, birch, yew, and other trees sacred
to those who hold Nature dear to their hearts.  Intertwining around the leaves
is a delicate vine, representing the unity of those bound by the rings.  
Heartbreaking in its purity, it is nevertheless very sturdy and could probably
withstand the harshest of conditions.    ~

beard brown hair pile selyns-beard~
This fine beard is made of a light brown hair that, when worn, instantly
matches itself to the color of the wearer's hair (unless you have auburn hair,
and then it turns red).  Complete with connecting sideburns, it is not
ridiculously long like a dwarf's nor the short, weak beard of a half-elf.  It
is quite masculine.    ~

   It looks like it was made for a teenage girl, but this dress is very plain
with no ornamentation or embroidery.  The thick cloth it is made of - perhaps
linen - reaches down past the knees and looks like it isn't in the best shape.
Still, though plain, it serves its purpose well.    ~

   Stretchy and well-made, these tights would look absolutely smashing with the
right style of gothic clothing.  What better way to proclaim your indifference
to the world than to wear these tights?  The fabric isn't silk, though it is
light.  Rather, it's a stretchy material that seems unfamiliar.  Maybe they
were made with magic?    ~

making me ask all these questions?  I DON'T KNOW!  (A little button on the

The handle of this stiletto is skillfully made from heavy steel and glazed
black ivory from a stag's antlers.  A razor-sharp blade folds out from the
handle, about a hand-and-a-half in length.  Although somewhat heavy, the
stiletto can be wielded deftly within a sleeve, making an effective assassin's
weapon.    ~

ring wedding-ring-silver-ice-golden-fire gold shining beautiful auvcan-voltel-ring-unique~
This ring is small, yet anything but simple.  At first, it seems like a simple
ring of intertwining gold and silver strands lit with an inner fire, but it
feels alive, and indeed upon closer inspection it is revealed that the golden
bands have the glitter of living flame, flowing like molten flame around the
silver bands.  They also glimmer, but with the power of coldest ice.  One would
expect these two opposing elements bound together would destroy each other, but
instead the flame burns brighter and the ice rests cooler because of the
opposition inherent in them.  The binding is tighter than ever, a joyous
inclusion of difference.    ~

together.  Someone must have spent a very long time weaving it!    ~

Cast from the finest dwarven silver, this locket is beautifully carved and
decorated by wonderfully complex patterns and runes.  A tiny clasp on one side
locks the hinge on one side of the locket, enclosing the memories of those who
have passed on and become forgotten.  An aura of mourning and remoteness
surrounds the locket, flowing from the tiny portrait painted within-the face is
neither male nor female, neither old nor young.  Expressionless, the face
nevertheless seems to be lonely, crying for remembrance.    ~

This pile of rags could be used for clothing, maybe, if one weren't morally
opposed to wearing minimal clothing and one could not afford real clothes.  
Close inspection reveals the greyish-brown rags to be made of silk; it was
likely once a very fine garment.  Perhaps it has some magical properties?  
There is surely no other reason these rags haven't found their way to the
rubbish heap yet.    ~

These grey-brown rags may have once been proper clothing, but now the silk is
so torn and thin that they surely can't provide much protection.  Laces on one
end could be used to attach them to a shirt like a pair of sleeves, but anyone
with fashion sense would probably rather go without sleeves at all than use
these old things.    ~

It's a simple length of tattered, worn greyish-brown silk.  It looks like the
only thing it would be good for is a belt or sash.  The silk is torn and
threadbare, though, so even tying it in a knot might not be a very good idea
lest it break.  It looks more like something for the junk pile than a piece of
clothing.    ~
