fountain marble~
     This beautiful fountain appears to have been carved from a single block of
marble, rather amazing as it stands about twice your height and three times
that wide.  A series of basins carry water down the sides as they fill and
overflow, the glistening liquid eventually running out a large sluice on the
western side where the vast volume of water becomes a swift brook.
     All manner of the aviary's winged species wing about in the flowing water,
splashing the life-giving fluid all about as they make fun of the simple task
of bathing on this warm afternoon.  So many of the brilliantly-plumed creatures
light upon the marble basins that the fountain looks more a floral arrangement
than a sculpture.  Perhaps you wondered at first about the plainness of the
white marble, but as a backdrop for the avians it makes a perfect picture.
     Carved into the side of the fountain nearest you is some kind of
inscription, though you'd need to take a closer look to make out what the
letters say.  Just below the inscription is a circular carving of a beautiful
woman set bas-relief in the gleaming white stone.~

                          For the bounty of nature:

                  Shall you never forget the wonder of life

carving woman circular~
     The carving appears to be an image of the goddess Selina.  The sculpture
is surprisingly intricate, detailed so much so that you wonder what master
craftsman captured her beauty and essence so in such a simple medium.
     The scene rendered shows the goddess at home in her Waterfall Grotto.
Seeing her home you can easily comprehend her love of all things of nature; it is
of little wonder that she should touch the Aviary with her grace and grant the
citizens of the bleak north a respite from winter's grasp within these walls.~
E
water~
     The water spurts from the uppermost basin to first fill it and then flow
down through a series of bowls, pools, and basins until it pours into a swift
brook that moves off to the west.  The water is crystal-clear and refreshingly
crisp to the touch, likely melted ice from beyond the walls of the aviary.  The
liquid reminds you of your dry throat; surely the birds would not mind if you
took a small drink from one of the sparkling basins.~

beautiful-feathered-crest feather~
Long yellow and grey feathers make up this piece of stylish headwear.  Upon the
pate of some hapless bird it must have been beautifully expressive, as the
crest itself would swing up or lie back against the bird's head to express
interest, excitement, fear, and love.  Holding the feathered garment in your
hands, you cannot help but feel sorry for the bird and wonder if you might be
able to recreate even a degree of its vitality.~

loaf bread rye~
     Baked apparently from grains harvested within the aviary itself, this loaf
of bread is coarse and rather crude, but certainly looks appetizing to the
empty of stomach.  Breaking the dark brown loaf open, there are quite a few
whole kernels and seeds of grain still intact, and the flour certainly was
barely crushed and sifted.  Perhaps this bread was intended as more of a treat
for the birds above than for human consumption.~

Though not exactly industrial-sized, these garden shears have a wickedly- sharp
serrated edge to their blades and a handle that feels warm and heavy in your
palm.  Certainly they could clip through the most stubborn of dragon- shaped
shrubbery and perhaps even be turned to more gruesome ends - wouldn't those
blades do a number on someone's arm or fingers, and wouldn't it be something to
see the metal handles protruding from the back of yon adventurer?  Indeed, the
shears make for a nasty weapon.
 
There is an inscription of some sort along the handle.~

This warm, large garment is tailored entirely from feathers.  Upon closer
examination, the cloak looks to be made up of a long cape and two wings
attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.~

The beak of a parrot, this grey hook-shaped bill has razor-sharp edges honed
daily by its former owner.  Though most birds are not aggressive, only the most
foolhardy would not look to its own defense.  It looks as if someone has
drilled two holes in the sides of the beak and run a leather thong through them
so that you could tie the hookbill onto your head; it might also function well
as a kind of dagger in hand.~

is speckled with tiny flecks of blue and yellow, giving it an almost marbled
appearance.  The egg is warm in your hand, and you can almost feel the beating
of a tiny heart inside it.  Perhaps if kept properly warm and cared for, in a
few days the most wonderful of treasures might be discovered inside.~

nasty-bird-droppings bit~
Yech!  Though the birds within the aviary's walls are far from domesticated - 
much less housebroken - happening upon such a nasty bit of droppings is an 
unpleasant surprise; generally the aviary grounds crew seem to do a pretty good
job keeping the paths clean, turning such offal into the soil to act as 
fertilizer for the exotic plant life.
 
The core of the droppings is a greenish-grey snakelike solid, surrounded by an 
off-white liquid that is quickly drying in the sun.  Though bird droppings do 
not have the disgusting smell of other animal feces, they are still rather 
repulsive nonetheless.~

     A slender brown stem supports a wide blossom of tiny seeds, giving the
millet spray the appearance of a cat's tail even down to the fuzzy filaments
growing all about the seeds much like tiny hairs.  Though perhaps the millet
does not look all that appetizing to you, to birds it is a treat on par with
ice cream and other unhealthy sweets.  Many a feathered flier can be seen about
the aviary picking away at the tiny but tasty seeds well into the evening
hours.~

These fine pants are made of a light fabric to which are sewn hundreds of soft
feathers.  The plumage looks to have come from all sorts of birds, with long
blue and green feathers likely from parrots lined up beside the smaller browns,
whites, and greys of birds like finches and budgerigars.  Though their value as
armor might be questionable, the breeches do look to be rather warm and even
comfortable - and a must-have for every dandy's wardrobe!~

bloodfeather blood feather~
     Once a feather is completely grown and mature it is like human hair - dead
and unfeeling.  However, as they grow in, a bird's feathers have their own
blood supply and can indeed feel pain.  Occasionally something happens to cause
a bird to break or otherwise lose one of these bloodfeathers.
     Other than the dark vein of red down its center and its broken, uneven
end, this feather seems like any other.  Whatever bird lost it must have had
spectacular yellow and blue plumage... but what good is it to you?~

Made of a thin, stretchy material lined with a warm layer of fuzzy down, these
sleeves would be perfect for keeping your arms warm beneath your overcoat.  
However, the thin material would provide little benefit for warriors and might
seem even a bit sissified for the more beastly of occupations.  The thin
material has enough stretch to it that you might even be able to wear the
sleeves about your legs like a pair of tights in a stretch (no pun intended!

tourmaline stares back as the bird's eyes, small citrines and rubies create the
distinctive orange cheek patches, and smoky quartz and clear diamonds make up
the feathers.~
