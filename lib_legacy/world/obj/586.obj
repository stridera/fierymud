spyglass spy-glass cylindrical object~
This object is made up of many cylinders in progressive sizes that collapse to
make a little object the size of a drinking cup, and expands to form a long,
narrowing tube with glass at either end.  When you look through it, you can see
things close up, or so the legends go.~

Fine purple cloth, unwrinkled linen, forms what is clearly a robe of high

It's just a plain green glass bottle. It doesn't seem
to be ornamented at all, or marked in any way, which is
odd, since most bottle manufacturers mark their wares.~

They're made of shiny, polished steel that straps on to their wearer's upper
arms.  They're jointed a bit near the elbow to allow freedom of movement; you
watch the joints click into and out of place with fascination.~

You observe well-tanned brown leather cunningly worked into a pair of shoes
that lace with a thong across the arch of the foot.  They're quite new-looking,
even smelling of leather still.  You can tell the material is soft and supple.~

The map is very blurry and hard to make out, as if water has been
spilled on it very often, or sprayed across it.
