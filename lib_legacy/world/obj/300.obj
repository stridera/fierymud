trough watering water~
The trough is made of thick blank planks pegged together in a long "V" shape.
It is rather huge, and would have to be to supply the stream of orc soldiers
who fill buckets from it frequently.  Though orcs are not known for their
hygiene, the water appears to be clean and clear.  Naturally it is covered with
graffiti.    ~

Potatoes are notoriously easy to grow and useful for eating, but that
doesn't make them any less bland.  Thankfully, it appears that a non-orc
cook had a hand in the preparation of this cake, for it has been heavily
flavored with strong but not offensive spices.~

There's nothing simpler to prepare than raw liver: even a knife is
optional. This is a recipe that even orcs couldn't screw up. Unfortunately,
it takes a particular kind of palate to appreciate it... one that could

This cruel implement looks to be forged from iron, though crudely.  It has a
short shaft to which is attached the iron head.  A long "chin" extends downward
a ways to give it a longer cutting edge, and it is rather heavy.  Given the
chips and scratches, it has been used as much as a club as a slashing weapon.~
