mask skull-mask~
This mask is crafted from the chiseled off face of a humanoid skull.  It has
several leather straps bolted to it as securing points to hold it on the head.
The skull is painted with blood and other pigments around the eyes, teeth, and
cheeks to accentuate the contours of the bone, amplifying its horrifying shock
value.  Quite a grotesque trophy indeed!~
