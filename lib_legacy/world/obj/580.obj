This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.    ~
