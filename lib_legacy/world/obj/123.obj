crisscross the surface of the planet.  Like most menhir, this one bears no

adornment adornment-light shimmering-glint-light small-chain~
A small ball of light glows from an unknown source, but somehow still 
remains attached to a shining platinum chain.  It looks like a common 
necklace, except for the small glint of light that emits tiny beams that 
illuminate the palm of your hand.  Occasionally the light grows brighter for 
an instant, then fades back to normal.  ~

bracelet small stone gold beads consecrated spirit bracelet-consecrated-spirit~
   The bracelet is formed from small beads of gold and grayish colored stones.
It is very old and shows the marks from years of use.  The stone beads are
cracked and worn down on the edges and a few of them have chipped apart.  The
gold beads are starting to tarnish and fade, almost matching the dull luster of
the stone, from prolonged contact with the sweat from the skin.~

This belt appears to be made of small silver discs set with dark blue starstone
hemispheres.  However, upon closer inspection, you realize the glittering dots
within the hemispheres are not merely reflecting light - they are diminutive
pinpoints of luminescence contained in some kind of crystalline matrix.  They
swirl and float, giving a cosmic life to each disc.  Surely a treasure like
this must be a gift from the Gods!~

pinpoint light star seed starseed~
Examining this tiny light more closely, it becomes obvious this is no meager
glass or crystal.  It is the heart of a newborn star, breathed into creation
through divine providence.  Within it lay all the hopes and dreams of creation,
which perhaps could become another legendary soul, or a cosmic array of life
and potential.~
