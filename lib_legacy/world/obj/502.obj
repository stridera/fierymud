It looks quite delicate, yet it has survived despite being in a shipwreck.  
The spout and the upper rim are lightly gilded, while exquisite paintings of
dragons and phoenixes adorn its side.  On the bottom, a few masterful strokes
of an unknown artist's brush have left a pair of complex figures that are
indecipherable to you.  The are encircled by an irregular line that appears to
be the coast of an island.    ~
