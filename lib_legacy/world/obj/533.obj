is a small dragon, its head raised toward the sky.  Water gently flows
out of its open mouth.  Considering the temperature in this cavern you are
amazed that the water has not frozen.  A plaque affixed to the base of the
fountain reads, "Water Bringeth Life."~

   Lowly traveler, many a strong man and woman have taken to
   exploring these tunnels, and few have returned as they entered.
   The tunnel to the south leads to the ruthless horde known as the
   Dragon Cult.  The tunnels west lead to a large section of land known
   local people as Frost Valley.

   From those who have lost loved ones, we wish you a safe journey,
   and hope that you are able to avenge the deaths of those who have
   traveled before you.~

inside which definately comes from something else being present, but it would
take a dragon's eye to see for certain while the case is closed.    ~
