Bringing fists down on the weak
Smashing their souls
And breaking the meek

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence

black casting of the metal gives it a very durable finish and it looks to be
unused.  Whoever was the keeper of this key did a very good job of protecting
it from the elements.~

This hammer is not a weapon, but a tool.  Although it could do some serious
damage in a fight, the weight is misaligned for combat and the head too small
for solid hits.  A trained eye can spot that is because the hammer's true
purpose is creation, not destruction.  Blessed by spirits of the earth for
working on grand design of the universe, this hammer is a perfect tool for a
true forgemaster.~

trumpet long-trumpet polished-trumpet~
This kind of trumpet is traditionally used for heraldry to announce the coming
of knights or kings.  While well cared for, it bears clear signs of regular
use.  If it could speak, what stories of nobility and honor would it tell?~

staff electricity~
   The blue and white bolts crackle and sizzle, but still are bound together to
form a staff.  The top of the staff burns the brightest and emits an occasional
shower of sparks.  It is constantly shifting colors and shape, allowing the
user to control it actions to achieve maximum damage.~
