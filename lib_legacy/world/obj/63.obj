gloves dragon hide dragon-hide pair a-pair-of-dragon-hide-gloves venath~
Though they are indeed solid brown leather, these gloves appear to be covered
in thick smoke which eminates from the pores of the leathery surface.  The
effect of the distortion from the smoke is akin to a heatwave passing through
the desert.  Although by appearances they should offer little in the way of
protection, these gloves boast the strength and resiliance of the dragon whose
skin they were crafted from.  There appears to be an inscription on the inside
of the right hand glove.~

Emblazoned in the leather on the inside of the cuff reads:
