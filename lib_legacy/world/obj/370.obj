To Mesmeriz of the Minithawkin Mines
Dated The 11th Day of the Month of Heroes and Valor, Year 468.
From Arseynh Z'Kenian
Z'Kenian House
Dheduu

Regarding the status of your request.  House Z'Kenian is more than
willing to trade soulsteel in exchange for thawkinixa, however
be aware that this is done without sanction of the city's ruling
body, House Kar'Shezden.  As such, we are unable to comply with the
second part of your request and we are unable to free the city's
troll slaves in exchange for dwarven ones softened by mind control
tactics.  The secret of forging adamantium must likewise remain
with the drow until further negotiations can be made.
Should you find these conditions acceptable, please respond with
all haste.
We await your reply.~

different shades ranging from dark moss to the pale green of new leaves.  It is
considered a soft stone, so it is possible that it was once polished but became
chipped.  However, this green stone is often found deep inside mountains.
