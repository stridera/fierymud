This wicked-looking axe is a massive single-headed axe forged from some kind of
blackened steel.  The head has several jagged protrusions, like the spines on a
dragon's back.  The blade is slightly curved outward, but also has several
sharp jagged angles cut along its edge.  It is attached to a pure black wooden
haft, dark as the night.~

This long weapon is somewhere between a lance and an axe.  It has a single
straight blade with a sharpened edge, much like an axe, but with a long curving
tip like a lance.  Attached to a simple metal haft, the weapon is heavy and
brutal.~

Where many tools dedicated to demonic forces are heavily detailed with runes
and symbols indicating their dark purpose and their masters, this blade has
none of those traditional trappings.  A blade made of blackened steel, sharp
yet unrefined, produced for one purpose only: to shed blood in the name of
Demon Lords.  On it is a single eye, the symbol of Yeenoghu, the Beast of
Butchery, so he may watch every kill up close.~

flail flail-yeenoghu massive-three-headed-flail~
Named for the Demon Lord Yeenoghu's holy weapon, this massive and deadly triple
flail is not in fact the real artifact, though it is an impressive replica and
still extremely potent.  Weapons such as these are carried by Fangs of
Yeenoghu, warrior-shamans imbued directly with a demonic spirit by Yeenoghu
himself.  This one has three spike-headed orbs dangling from long chains,
attached to a sturdy haft.  A bulging eye is drawn on each orb in blood, an
invocation of Yeenoghu to watch the butchery committed in his name.~

This large suit of armor is made from several large sections of tanned hide,
stitched together in layers with sinews and cord.  The hides clearly come from
several different creatures, lacking uniformity of texture or color.  A full
broad collar and shoulder pads have been collaged together, and the panels hang
long, covering some of the hips and waist for full coverage of the torso.  
Some of the sections have fur pressed between them, and other parts are
embellished with fox tails and other large fur pads.  The overall effect is a
patchy, mangy look.~

This kind of magical stone is also known as an Ioun stone, named for an old god
of knowledge and prophecy.  The tiny crystal is cut into the shape of a
hexagonal geometric prism -- six slender faces around a flat base.  Unlike an
optical prism, this crystal does not bend light in any spectacular way, but
does color it vaguely rose-hued.~

Faceplates like this were issued in the early days of the campaign to sack
Tyllwedd and establish a base of operations for orcish campaigns in South
Caelia.  They became keepsakes for the soldiers who fought in that campaign
after Ogakh was established as a permanent settlement and most of the Army
conscripted to town guard duty.~

pyrite still makes lovely jewelry.  This tiny nugget is mounted to a small

has long jagged spikes on it so if need be you can use the other side as a
