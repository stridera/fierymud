carefully dyed streaks of red, orange, and white, giving it the appearance of a
large willowy flame.  It is hemmed by a light blue ribbon with a small cinch on
one side to tighten the hood around the head.~

ruby~
The gold amulet's ruby is immaculate, and much larger than the average jewel.
It seems to glow with an inner warmth.  As you look into its center, words fill
your thoughts...

...the Shiori was once an order of the pyromantic arts which was dedicated to
the understanding and furtherment of magic.  The Prime Shior was the greatest
of these mages, and the head of the Kerristone-based order.  But even he could
not escape the Great Crash, and he perished along with the others whom the gods
deemed infidels.  As the Towers of Shiori fell upon him, he flung his amulet
through time itself, such that the Shiori legacy might not be forgotten...~

extremely comfortable due to their mink fur lining.  The exterior is a soft
velvet trimmed in silver threading sewn into intricate Technitzitlian patterns.
Each armhole hangs loosely, stretching large enough at the mouth to fit a small
child.  A large hood hangs from the back of the collar, allowing the wearer's
features to be hidden even in broad daylight.  A series of golden scales lines
the hem of the robes, clinking softly as the fabric sways.~
