redwood-staff red-wood~
This is a fine looking staff carved from the finest redwood you've ever had the
pleasure of seeing.  Its the kind of staff you'd expect an up-and-coming mage,
druid, or cleric to keep handy.~

Other than the fact that the lantern is larger than normal and is
made from an odd reddish metal, there is nothing particularly unusual
about the lantern. You would imagine it has a long life though.~

starmail-vest star-mail~
The vest is comprised of interlocked star-shaped pieces of metal sewn to a
thick vest of leather.  The concept seems similar to that of ringmail, at least
to the untrained eye.  You imagine that this vest might be slightly tougher
than your average ringmail, although it does not appear to be magical in any
way.~

The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its brightness is nearly
unbearable to look at, but somehow seems to cast a cool glow across the area.~
