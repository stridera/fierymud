The deep red leg spur has been cruelly broken from the leg of a Hiver. Cracked
bits of chitin crumble from the body end as a clear fluid slowly drips out. The
lower edge has a softly undulating wave pattern running from the narrow tip to
the broken end, forming a key-like series of bumps.~

Tiny scales overlap along the length of the spur, making it slightly rough to

Dried blood forms a second covering on the spur. Hair-line cracks run its
length in a series of parallel fractures. Several small chips have been
cracked out of the two major spikes on the inner edge.~

A series of fine serrations nicked out of the two under-side spikes give the 
spur a wicked and unique cutting edge. They would act like a saw on anyone
who had the misfortune to be on the receiving end of a slash. Too bad that
the end is too badly broken to form a handle. Maybe the one of a kind edge
has a different intent...~

The Attendant's leg spur has a softly feathered edge of tattered chitin.
Long ribbons hang down in imitation of a brush. As your hand smooths them
back, you notice that the trimmings form a distinct band of bumps similar
to the notches of a key.~

This cloak was once quite fancy and shaped perfectly.  Now, however, it is torn
and somewhat discolored.  The silvery lining is shredded and has lost its glint
and sparkle.  The owner of such a cloak must have been quite wealthy, and it is
a wonder why such a precious item would go to waste.  It has a lone, long faded
symbol across the back.~
