This impressive staff is made from a large rough aspen branch, decorated with
feathers and gemstones.  The rough, powdery white bark of the branch is left
natural, the dark cracks forming lighting bolt-like images along its length.  
The cracks are highlighted with a flowing coppery metal, which erratic sparks
streak along.  The sparks arc and leap along the haft, converging at a large
diamond mounted in the head.  It flashes and crackles, a swirling storm visible
inside the perfectly clear stone.  The wild electrical field around the staff
is palpable.~

This staff is made of a long and slender yew branch, about 6 feet in length.  
Iconography evoking earth and mountains is carved across the entire length.  
The sigils are highlighted with iron inlay and sporadically dotted by small
beryls.  A large chunk of striped malachite, lacking signs of working or
cutting, is embedded in the head of the staff, serving as the focal point for
the energy.~

human, represents pinnacle mastery over the very essence of elemental earth
itself.  It is capable of using the forces of the earth to pull apart and
disintegrate any object or creature it encounters.  Decorated heavily with
runes and sigils of earth and death and topped with a large pure emerald, the
staff is an exquisite masterwork of elemental craftsmanship - the perfect

it's actively devouring the light around itself.  A palpable evil radiates from
the mace, yet it seems to be kept in check by something much greater.  Perhaps
this weapon is a tangible example of the old adage of fighting fire with fire.

trophy wolf-eye-tattoo wolf-eye-tattoos dark-ink-bottle~
This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  The tattoo covers both eyes, exaggerating the
natural eyes of the one it adorns.  The iris is a striking yellow to add an
element of intensity to the tattoo.  Highly detailed fur surrounds the eye,
extending onto the cheeks and eyebrows, with each strand of hair carefully
drawn to create a sense of texture and depth.  It is a powerful and striking
image that captures the essence of this majestic animal.~

trophy eagle-eye-tattoo dark-ink-bottle~
This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  The tattoo is designed in black ink
highlighted by white, brown, and golden ink.  The iris of the eye is deep
amber, adding an element of intensity and vibrancy to the tattoo.  Feathers in
shades of white, brown, gold, and black, spread out from the central visage.  
The eagle's eye tattoo carries deep symbolic meaning: it represents freedom,
courage, and a connection to the natural world.  It also serves as a reminder
of the bearer's own inner strength and determination.~

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  This eye is one of the many smaller eyes found
on a creature known as a beholder.  The eye is round and white, with a purple
iris and vertically slitted pupil like a cat's eye.  Even if it wasn't glowing
the palpable magical aura around the eye would immediately reveal the mystical
nature of the thing.~

trophy eternal-rest ethereal-spheres~
This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  The spheres glow with a faint blue ghost
light.  Upon closer inspection it seems these orbs are eyes of some kind.  
Being certain is difficult as they are blurry and indistinct, fully ethereal
and translucent, so details are hard to make out.  Yet you can feel something
piercing through you, like the spheres are looking right through your very
soul.~

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  This thing could only be described as
somewhere between a blob of gas and a bubble of jelly.  There is just a touch
of color in it, a pale sea-green, soft and shimmering and very beautiful.  It
floats, quite peaceful, but pulsing gently, as though it were breathing.  
Within it, images from far-away worlds, places that only exist in dreams,
burble and pop.~

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  This tattoo gives the bearer the look of an
archetypical beast, combining intricately detailed scales, elaborate feathers,
and ridged horns along the temples.  Bold colors, reds, blues, greens, golds,
burst out of the design to emphasize power and strength.  The ink is infused
with the blood of the greatest beasts from all across Ethilien.  Infused with
such power, the tattoo causes the bearer's eyes to burn with a fierce inner
light, piercing the dark with fiery determination.~
