You behold the legendary Stormcloak, once worn by the mighty Stormlord, Holder
of Tempests, himself.  The dark indigo cloth the cloak is made of scintillates,
giving the impression of thousands of tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into
its brocade surface.  It's quite heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held
together by a bronze clasp, beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon
whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you
look at it, touch it.~

You see a bouncy red rubber ball! It's so big you can barely hold it in 
one hand. You think it'd be a lot of fun to try balancing it on your 
head, as well.~

feather wing-feather-cavern-hawk cavern-hawk-wing-feather immense-feather quill pen~
This is the primary flight feather of the giant cavern hawks near the
Stormchild's keep.  Dark gold in color, it is nearly three feet long.  If
someone were large enough, they could probably use it as a quill pen, but other
than that it would make a nice trophy.~

baton lightweight-baton leight-weight condensation slender-metallic-rod~
The baton feels extremely cool to the touch, as if its brushed metal surface is
pulling all the heat from its surroundings.  It feels hollow and perfectly
balanced, yet the metal seems to be somewhat stronger than anything this light
should be.~

These jesses are made of thick dark-brown leather thongs wrapped around what
seems to be leather gloves.  The thongs dangle a bit, but just looking at the
jesses make you aware of how fast and agile a true falconer must be.  Perhaps
wearing these will make you feel like that as well.~

You hold a beautiful key with a most fascinating property-- its surface 
looks like clouds, and the clouds move across it as if it were a piece of

You see a key fit for a small child-- larger than most keys, simplistic 
in design, and strung on a pretty red ribbon, so its wearer would be sure 
not to lose it.~
