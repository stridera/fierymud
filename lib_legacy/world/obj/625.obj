Shaped in this glass is the face of a raging bear.  The mere sight of it's
terrible eyes are disturbing.  It seems so real!  It hums with the power of the
awful bear trapped inside it, barely contained.  You wonder if it's even safe
to handle.~

Nothing.
   Obviously whoever wrote this note lacks the linguistic skills needed to write
legibly and convey coherent thought.  It seems very disorganised, and drifts
upward as you read.  It was scribled with charcoal onto the back of a 30 year
old eviction notice.  The paper is crumpled, and dirty.~

punchknuckles knuckles pit-fiend curse cursed red-mattalic-shackles demonic-symbol link chain~
the Pit Fiends Shackles~
Red, metallic shackles lay on the ground here, a strange demonic symbol forms the center link of the chain.~
   The shackles look other-worldly, an unidentifiable metal stained an
impossible shining red.  The shackles are held together by a chain of the same
metal, just over a hands width in length.  Forming the central link of the
chain is a large currious shape of the metal.  You hesitate to peer closer at
the dark symbol, because it induces a sickening feeling, instinctually
recognised as demonic evil.~

dark-symbol strange demonic rune center-link~
   Upon closer inspection the central link is sized to fit each of your hands,
gripping on either side of it.  Then length of the central chain places the
ruin comfortably between your two wrists such that this grip is easy and
natural to form while wearing the shackles.  The rune has a vertical
double-line doen the center, with sharp cylindrical knobs jutting outward
toward the holders hands.  The inner edges of these two virticle lines are
spaced by eight tightly packed horizontal spikes, pointing in alternating
dirrections, their wicked points tucked safely into the opposing wall of the
cage they form.  You can see that when gripped, the symbol would easily slide
into what seems like two spiked knuckles, though the backward-facing
cylindrical knobs would make then impractical, even dangerous, to the users
exposed knuckles.  What a strange design.~
