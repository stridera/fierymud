slender-ornate-dagger~
The blade of this slender dagger is about a half foot long and razor sharp on
both edges.  It looks like it was made of a particularly bright alloy of steel
and silver, with not a nick marring its surface.  The hilt is hardwood set with
gold chain, its pommel carved into an eagle's head.~

rapier sword ornate bright~
This slender rapier is long, its blade not sharp but is point wickedly so.
It is made of some very bright alloy of steel that looks almost silvery,
and its hilt is wrapped in blue leather. The crossguard is the traditional
basket hilt, but very ornately done, sweeping and scrolling.~

longsword sword well balanced tower~
It is a well-balanced weapon with a double-edged blade that is
somewhat sharp at the point. A scrolled bronze crossguard protects
the hand, and the wooden hilt is wrapped with chain for a good grip.
It is not a fancy weapon, but it is effective-looking. An insignia
in the pommel identifies the sword as belonging to one of Kerristone's
tower guards, to those who would recognize such things.~
