wrapped with a bright vermilion cloth, providing padding and distinctiveness.

This Draconium catalogues the species of dragons represented in the
Duclian senate at the time of writing, the 11th Day of the Month of
Revolution, 14 MIE.  It magically updates itself, listing only the
species of dragons surviving.
 
The dragons are separated into three major groups based on alignment,
and each of these further divided into two groups each, the true dragons
and the supplementals.  For the first three sections, each page
describes one species of dragon, listing their alignment, type, average
length, breath weapon, any unique spells or skills they might exhibit,
whether they have the ability to shapeshift, and their relative strength
index.
 
The relative strength index is a device the Duclian Organizational Force
uses to rank species' relative powers.  It is only an average estimate.
These lesser races of the Creator are estimated to rank between zero and
ten, but no higher.
 
The final section of this catalogue details the powers and effects of
breath weapons, special skills, and draconian-specific spells.  The
appendicies also contains a page that will magically renew itself,
always reading the names of the current leaders of each draconian
faction.  At the time of this writing, the great 27 Senator Dragons are
listed.

  Kind and magnanimous, silver dragons enjoy helping those weaker

  of humans and elves.  Flying is a true pleasure to silvers,

  Bronze dragons are partial to deep water, enjoying aquatic food

  Oddly, brass dragons are the most social of all dragons, even

  Copper dragons have well-deserved reputations as pranksters,
  jokers, and riddlers, often staying out of the reach of opponents
  while shouting insults and abuses.  They are the most selfish and
  greedy of the good dragons.  Coppers often lair in dry mountain or
  hill caves.~

  Iron dragons' personalities usually match their steely hides,
  making them appear cold and unresponsive.  Nevertheless, they are
  strong-willed warriors of righteousness who never give up.  Their
  lairs are usually deep subterranean caves or abandoned mines.~

  Even more inflexible and relentless than their iron dragon cousins,
  steel dragons follow rigorous schedules and procedures, making
  excellent soldiers.  For their size, they are quite powerful,
  reflected by continual static crackling about their bodies.  Most
  steel-blue dragons lair in mountain caves.~

  Sapphire dragons are very territorial, quickly attacking intruders
  on their stomping grounds without asking questions first.  This
  trait is aided by their ability to fly extremely fast and their
  superior hearing.  They typically live deep underground in
  self-constructed burrows.~

amulet-true-shadows mass-shadow~
Formed of the essence of shadow itself, this amulet is darker and blacker than
anything you have seen before.  Its very existence seems negated by its
terrible blackness, a seeming void in the fabric of space.  Despite its utter
absence, it has a shifty, shadow-like mass that is easy to touch, but
impossible to grasp.  It somehow hangs upon a thick silver chain that looks
strong enough to be swung about.  The amulet of course has no detail, being
only shades of shadow, but it nevertheless seems to take on the form of a
mounted dragon...or perhaps it is just a trick of the light.~

Short and stout, this wand is about the size of a bottle, but made of a solid
shimmering white material.  Power runs through its length, manifesting as a
light blue aura glowing around it.  On one end, a golden ankh is imprinted in

wand-dead jet-black-wand shiftcorpse~
About the length of a shortsword, this wand is rather large, but a tingling
aura suggests that it may hold some unseen power.  Near one end of the wand, a
ring of small runes wraps around the wand.~
E
runes~
The writing on the wand is in an ancient elvish script and difficult to read,
but seems to describe the wand's contract and usage.  Tapping the wand's power
requires a binding and sacrifice as part of the contract with an unidentified
being of darkness.~

It looks like an egg, but is far too large!  The outer surface is glossier than

Perhaps the egg could be hatched, revealing its contents.    ~
