A small overflowing well lies in the middle of the cranberry patch.~
   The large well once supplied water to the surrounding farmlands until a
backwash in the underground aquifer pushed water up the long well's walls and
overspilled onto the surrounding area, now its' continuous supply of rushing
water makes the area's produce ideal for the exotic cranberry.    ~

The robe glows brighter the nearer you go to inspect it.  Its large symbols
depict the tale of seasons and weather patterns long past.  Its owner must have
grown dumb to have left such a magical item lying around.~

The thin staff is as light as a hollowed out tube, but as strong as any metal
sword picked off the forge.  The green glow radiating from the brown oak gives
the impression that the stick is naturally green.  The glow seems to emanate a
deep wisdom.    ~

they are sweeter than full-grown carrots.  They're good for your eyesight too!~

With that acrid smell that follows fresh-grown tomatos, these small red tomatos
are only about the size of cherries.  The vine has four of them on it.  
Tomatos are usually used in sauces, but this smaller variety would go well on a
salad.~

It has a tough outer skin, but feels slightly squishy around the center
portion.  On both ends of the fruit are browned nubs.  One end looks as if it
has been broken off a branch or stem.  The fruit has a curious smell, quite

A brown husk protects the white meat of this nutty fruit from predators.  The
inside is also filled with a creamy, sweet milk-like liquid.  It's used as an
ingredient in many juices or, if dried, can be added to cakes and other sweets.~
