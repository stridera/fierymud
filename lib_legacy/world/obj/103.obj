It shimmers of its own light, constantly reflecting the emotional state of its
owner.  The setting is a delicate filgiree net that encases the crystal and
keeps it safe while still allowing it to be visible.  A strange energy shocks
anyone who tries to touch it directly unless the crystal is their own.    ~

This is a simple, fuzzy white towel.  It looks quite water-absorbant and is the
kind of thing you'd want to wear around your head to keep your hair from
getting soaked, or to dry off your hair in case it's already wet.  There's a
small tag on one end that reads, "Property of Phoenix Feather Hot Springs".~

This is a large, fluffy towel dyed dark green.  Though it is well-made, it
looks like it's seen plenty of use and has a slight sulfur smell from the
mineral water.  Still, it would be good either to dry oneself off or to wear
around the waist to preserve decency while bathing.  A small tag on one of the
hems says "Phoenix Feather Hot Springs".~

The rims are a thin silver and the nosepiece seems quite comfortable.  They
would surely be a great help to someone who has no near-vision that wants to
read a book or crochet or do anything else that requires them to see things
close up.    ~

This finely woven cloak is made of pure white satin with cotton embroidery
marking out an abstract bird symbol on the back which, though it is also in
white, shows up in string light due to the difference in luster between the two
fabrics.  Long ties at the neck can be used to fasten the cloak against the
chill winds of the north.  It looks like it would also make great camoflauge in
the snow.~

This light blue robe is decorated with a feather pattern, identifying it as
belonging to the Phoenix Feather Resort west of Ickle.  The style is familiar
to anyone who knows the customs of Odaishyozen: it's meant to be worn in the
same way as a kimono.  Because it's made of cotton rather than silk and
designed for more casual wear, this style of robe is called a yukata.  It was
probably designed by someone from the resort who visited the Emerald Isle.~

since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~
