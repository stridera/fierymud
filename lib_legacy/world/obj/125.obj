book page1 part1~
9th day of the Month of Discovery, 352

   If your reading this, well, the plans didn't go off correctly.  I wanted a
legacy to carry on.  This tower was to be it.  In my days, I saw many places,
full of traps and treachery, but also of wealth and other spoils.  I strived to
leave such a place myself.  Alas, I plan on destroying these notes when it is
done, thus if you are reading this, the tower is not.  As I write this, the
enchanted tower has been completed ; a grand four stories tall.  It's too bad I
will be destroying part of it soon.  . .
 
  Work will not be finished for months, I fear, and with my ailing health, I
may not live to see it done.  I've called upon many favors - I'm afraid even my
soul will be the cost in the end.  So far, there's not much loot in here, most
has been sold for the protectors of the castle.  Sweet irony.    

   In the end, I have turned to demons to protect the lair, and slave labor to
build it.  What have I become.  Perhaps this is what is truly killing me.  Tis
only luck that the blue dragon has made the tower his perch.  What would it
cost for such a guardian?    

The writing continues in part2, part3, part4, part5, part6, part7~
E
part2~
   First, I ask myself, why am I building this tower?  I have adventured for
many years, and have always been fascinated by places I had gone, both in the
architecture, and the secrets held within.  I have decided to leave a legacy
behind me.  Someone has to die for a tomb to be looted.    

   Alas, with a life of adventure came a life with no heirs, so my money is
worthless after I die anyhow.  I am still in good health now, but getting older
every day.  Thus, my life's goal.    

   I have enlisted a few of my more mystical friends for the construction.  
This shall be no ordinary tower, by any means.  For one, we have concocted an
enchantment for the stone of the tower, such that it shall rebuild itself if
e'er it gets destroyed.  The bits of stone are attacted to one another, such
that no matter the distance, they will slowly be pulled together again.  Yea,
it may take millenia if they are far apart, but the tower shall never be
destroyed.    ~
E
part3~
   This was quite costly, but I believe it will be a good investment in the
long run.  No matter what happens, the tower will never quite die.    
 
   The basement has been created.  We decided upon an infinite hallway to
protect my study.  It too wasn't terribly hard to create, merely a modified
dimension door spell.  I had to give up my grandmother's broach, though, to get
the work done.  My friends are quite stingy, they are.    

   Finding workers from an area far enough away that they won't be able to find
their way back was quite tough.  The southern continent was a good choice.  To
get back without help, they'd have to raft the blue fog sea.  I've ne'er seen a
bigger ship down there in my days.  Getting them back there will be tougher.  
Our ride got called off to tend to her father, dying of old age. ~
E
part4~
   Had the druid community not severed ties with me after the unfortunate
incident in the forest...  I hadn't honestly meant to hurt anything, especially
not the animals, and how was I to know that the owl was a shapechanger...  
Life would be much easier. 

   We just had a few incidents in the construction.  The sub basement floor
collapsed.  It turns out a giant worm has burrowed under the tower.  It turns
out to have some intelligence, I think.  I... agreed to keep it fed if it
did no damage.  I didn't realize how much it eats.  We may need to exterminate
it.    

   Some fool put a door on the second floor of the tower to the outside.  
Unfortunately, they're nothing outside of it.  I've locked it to avoid any more
accidents.  Two deaths were bad enough.  Perhaps they would have survived, but
evidently the door happened to lead right above where the worm had burrowed,
thus the pit was quite deep.    ~
E
part5~
   Part of our labor force has decided to abandon the project.  A few of
them...  Were threatening to break their vow.  I had to put them down.  I think
the rest will understand the graveness of the situation, and will realize the
penalties for betraying me.    

   The work force has mutinied.  After hearing tales of what I did to those
that left, they snuck out after I offered them a two day break.  I will track
them down one by one and punish them all.  Traitors.  First, though, I must
find a replacement work force...  Work most continue - the tower must be
completed I have taken ill as of late, quite severely.  I hope it will pass,
but I must press on in case it does not.  I am ...  Seeking connections at the
moment.    

   I have sought an audience with the Demon Lord Krisenna.  We have struck a
deal; he seems quite benevolent at the moment.  Hopefully it will stay that
way.  The deal works in both our favors.  They provide the workers and
protection, and I provide them with a safe entry way into our world.  They have
finished the external tower, and have retreated into the bowels to finish up.~
E
part6~
   I have allowed them free reign to create themselves a sealed off passageway
to keep anyone who might make their way in from getting to them.  I am not even
allowed to see what they are doing there, lest I bother them, or give others
knowledge of how to do the same thing.    ~
E
part7~
   I have just stumbled back across this book, and it weighs heavily on my
mind.  I have seen my soul blacken over time.  Alas, I think it is too late for
me.  They have taken almost all of my goods as tribute, and they have an iron
grip on the tower.  I plot, hoping to find a way to get rid of them, but I fear
the deal is done.~

The flame seems to flicker about the vague shape of a key.  It seems to keep a
fairly solid form, although the flame dances.    ~

portal demon image mouth~
The giant floating image looks like the head of a powerful demon.  It's
exceedingly ugly.  Most of it is transparent, but the giant mouth - large
enough to walk through - surrounds an opaque, black, swirling mist.  It looks
as though it might lead somewhere, though whether it would be wise to enter is
another question entirely.    ~

The morning star is pitch black, absorbing all available light.  The ball is
large and quite hefty, and the handle is quite sturdy.  A fine weapon overall.~

dill umbel feathery flower flowers yellow green~
   A single stalk of dill, complete with a fist sized umbrel of yellow-green
flowers, grows in a small earthen pot.  Basking in the unnatural glow of the
room has benefitted the plant, which has a strong aroma.  The stalk seems to be
in good condition, nearly ready for harvesting of its oil.    ~

horn krisenna's-horn krisennas-horn single-cracked-horn skull demon~
This lone horn is very large and curved.  It is cracked and broken in two
places: a large break marks the spot where it was wrenched from the mighty
demon Krisenna's head, and a smaller break is higher up.  The smaller end is
worn, as if the horns were smoothed after the injury.  Whether this was done in
battle or for vanity is impossible to tell.  Some power remains in the horn,
damaged as it is.~
