Fighting knuckles like these are a set of four rings, fused in a line to fit
the four primary fingers of the human hand.  This particular set is made out of
electrum, an extremely rare alloy of gold and silver with traces of copper and
other metals, known for its alchemical resonance with thunder and lightning.  
Inscribed on each ring is a different alchemical symbol: an upward-pointed
triangle with a horizontal line for air; a three-angled line with a downward
pointing arrow for lightning; a circle with an up-right pointed cone joined by
an inverted moon for electrum; and a right-facing C-shaped curve bisected by a
bent line for thunder.~
