hat blue-captain's-hat blue-captains-hat~
The hat is obviously of the highest quality, if a bit weather-beaten.  The
light blue colour of the hat and the silver embroidery make it an attractive,
if eccentric, addition to anybody's wardrobe.~

thigh-bone white dragon long questobject~
This large white bone is as cold as ice or snow to the touch, yet shows no
signs of freezing.  From the shape, you guess this is a femur.  From the size
you assume it once belonged in a very large creature.~

dragon-bone-cup freezing cold~
Made from a single large bone, this cup has powerful magical properties which
make it ideal for storing and transporting liquids.  There are no markings or
signs of craftsmanship anywhere on the vessel.  Aside from being cold to the
touch, it is otherwise unremarkable.~
