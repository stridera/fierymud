fountain~
This large, carved marble statue dominates the center of this courtyard.  
There is a small statue of a knight in the middle, with the water of the
fountain gushing out from beneath the hooves of the great knight's steed.  The
knight has his head fixed, looking forwards into the future, his gaze following
his extended blade pointing fourth.  Just under where the water spills from the
darkened marble there is a small insignia written on a plaque.~

beast mist stuffed~
A lupine looking beast endemic to the Blue Fog Trail, this is a remarkably
large speciman standing almost waist high to a human.  This particular beast
is very dear to the hearts of the BoP, partly because it played a significant
part in their history, but more importantly because a divinely inspired
taxidermist built a still into the beast's carcass.  The output from the
still can be obtained from the left front nipple, where a small spigot has
been tastefully imbedded.  Traditionally the BoP mentor has been in charge of
caring for the still.~
