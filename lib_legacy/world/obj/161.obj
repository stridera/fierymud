shield hide-shield camel-hide~
Poorly constructed of rough wood with a thick layer of tightly stretched camel
hide over it, this shield nevertheless does its job, standing between its
wearer and attackers.  It appears to have seen quite the history of violence,
with numerous gashes and dents in the hide, but still holds together somehow.~
