The soles are the thick soles of traveling shoes, the kind befitting a

created a piece of gear that wonderfully combines function with aesthetic for
some flare on the go.~

brocade fabric provides a stiffness and stability a more traditional doublet
lacks without the boning of a full corset.  A loose rose motif typical of
Soltan work is woven in with lustrous threads.  It is trimmed with small pearl
bangles around the bottom and top edges, accentuated with golden fasteners.  
Truly a masterwork garment!~

Brocade is a very uncommon material for shoes because of how dirty they can
get.  That makes shoes like these extraordinarily rare.  This pair of slippers
is fine brocade stitched over leather for both comfort and support.  The loose
woven pattern of a Soltan rose is accentuated with golden embroidery and
gemstone beads.  A lavish buckle decorates the face of the shoe.  A small
sensible heel adds just that extra touch of height and composure while still
being possible to walk and dance in.~
