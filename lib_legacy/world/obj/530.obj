flaming-sword longsword blue-flame long-sword~
This mighty sword was the prized possession of the Lizard King, ruler of the
Great Northern Swamp.  Forged from mythril and enchanted in the depths of the
castle beneath the swamp, the sword was created to bring fire to the darkest of
places and burn all enemies before it.  It is truly a staggering weapon to
behold!~

Fine lines radiate from coin-sized circles.  Within the circles is an area of
nullity or nothingness which looks neither blank nor inscribed; they are simply
empty.  The circles are connected by thin lines of ink in no obvious pattern.
