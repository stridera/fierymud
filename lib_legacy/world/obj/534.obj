Title: The Lost Library of Shiran
Author: Karlix the Omniscient

"...and a great civilization rose and prospered.  They achieved such
wealth and status and they did not want the knowledge they had gathered
and strove for to be lost to succeeding generations.  So they built a great
library on an island off the coast of their great city.  Into this library
they placed all the knowledge they had gathered over the centuries.  Great
tomes about life, mythical creatures, far away and mythical lands, great
items of magic, etc, etc.  Such was the knowledge that they possessed that
it is rumored the gods got jealous and deemed the information kept in that
library too great for mortal minds.  And so, it is rumored it was the
gods who destroyed the Library and with it all the knowledge kept
therein..."~

visor sleet-visor semicircle-thin-white-metal semi-circle~
This thin visor is cast from a mysterious white metal.  Apparently stronger
than steel, despite its thinness, it is almost impossible to deform.  A strap
hanging around the back allows the visor to be worn on the head to protect the
face.  Several vertical slits give the wearer a clear view of the surroundings.~

guard sleet-guard small-diamond-shaped-shield~
Displaying an elaborate elven crest on its front, this sleet-white shield is
only as wide as a forearm is long, but used effectively could provide decent
protection.  The metal of the guard is fantastically thin, yet seems as strong
as, if not stronger than, well-tempered steel.~

elven-crest~
The elaborate elven crest is painted on the front of the sleet shield with
amazing detail.  It depicts a great lynx running on a blue background, with a
waving banner above it.  Some ancient elven runes are written across the
banner, but below the crest, the name Shiran appears in common script.    ~
