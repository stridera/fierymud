Composed entirely of a dark adamantium, the scimitar-shaped blade writhes and
crackles as a thick, black smoke billows off its edge while the handle is as
cold to the touch as the wintry nights of Mt.  Frostbite.  Balancing the hand
guard and mounted at the end of its slope on either side are two perfectly
rounded fiery gemstones.    ~

This whip is long and has several cat-tails on the end, eight of them to be
exact.  Each is tipped with a little metal spike that appears never to become
dull.  Even up and down the entire length of the leather portions of the whip
are little magically made barbs.  The handle is stripped &5&bcrushed velvet,&0
soft in the hand, yet hard underneath.  There is a small knot of wood at the
base of the handle with the sign that a weapon's master created this fine whip
with the aid of a magician.    ~

small-green-tree~
This is a small green tree grown in the shape of a shield.  It has several
branches coming out of the sides acting as perfect spikes on the sides of the
shield.  There is a heavy knot in the center almost as though the tree were
designed to actually act as a shield.  It is a strong wood, firm and hard and
ready to deflect most any blow landed upon it.  There are even some small
leaves hanging off of the branches which neatly conceal a small hole in the
wood.    ~
