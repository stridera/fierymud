burnt-wooden-staff smoke-charred-staff-wood~
Probably carved from an oak branch, this staff is charred almost completely
black.  A few carvings remain on the staff, but they are difficult to make out.
Recently burned, the staff is still warm, smoking lightly.    ~

cloak hooded shadows~
This cloak is made out of a coarse black cloth.  As you look at this large
cloak you notice that the hood is larger than usual.  As you look closer you
see that there are shadows running thorugh this cloak.  It must be magical for
great power seems to come forth from it.    ~

fountain cracked dark~
This fountain is made of a dark material but you cannot tell because of all the
blood that is all over it.  It seems this fountain has been the sight of many a
battle and that many a man have died next to or on it.  It once was probably a
grand fountain from the pieces you see left of it.  But now all there is left
is cracked remains.    ~

You are lucky you even found this key.  It is composed of some dark material
and hides very well in dark areas.  It must open some dark secret place.    ~

chest cracked~
This is a very old chest.  The dust on the top of it shows that it has not been
opened for years.  The long cracks along the side are large but not large
enough to look inside the chest.  It must have been dropped from above a long
time ago to be hidden from someone.  It looks like there might be treasure
inside.    ~
