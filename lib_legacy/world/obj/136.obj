tarnished-silver-necklace old-looking-silver-necklace~
This ancient-looking necklace is ornate, with a long, boxy silver chain set at
the edges of a large, triangular chestpiece shaped like a rearing dragon.  
Dramatic, but dented, and very much in need of polishing.~

It is a wooden cane, just long enough to hold onto its bulbous end and use to
aid in walking.  It's slightly dinged up from time and the elements, but it
maintains its usefulness.~
