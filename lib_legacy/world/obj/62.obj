sea-blue-silk-gown~
It is a beautifully cut dress, with a sweetheart neckline and puff-shoulder
sleeves that flare past the wrists.  The v-shaped waistline flows down to a
skirt that, instead of being gathered at the waist, is gored near the bottom
for fullness by the addition of triangular panels to the seams.~
