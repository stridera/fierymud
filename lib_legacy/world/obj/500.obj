fountain pristine marble beautiful~
This beautiful fountain is carved completely from marble, which seems to flow
flawlessly into the carved cobblestones of the same, delicate pink color.  
Water bubbles high from a tower rising from the center of the fountain, a tower
which very much resembles one of the town towers rising high overhead to the
east of here.  The leaders of this great city are surrounding the base of the
tower facing outward, hands raised as if they are holding their great city up
to be glorified by the heavens.

The golden elven leaves sparkle without reflecting any light.  The glinting
appearance comes from the ring itself, and would probably serve to warm the
finger it is worn on.

green elvin dagger~
This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.

The statue is of a heroic-looking woman, but it's impossible to see
her features or even what she's wearing and wielding. The statue is
made of the finest white marble, but it's been burned and charred
until it's barely recognizable as marble, and pieces of it lie on the
ground around the ornate base.
