of bones. It is in fairly good shape for a skeleton, and cannot have lain here
for more than a few years. Black mould grows in blotches all over.~

It's a short length of leather, broken at one end, and crumbling with age.  
There are a few small holes at the unbroken end, suggesting that it may once
have been a strap, perhaps part of a piece of armor.    ~

sliver dagger knife steel-sliver~
This is a splinter of steel in an elongated triangle.  The long edge is sharp,
though it might be handled with some care.  Embossed decoration and the
peculiar way the metal curves away from the edge seem reminiscent of the fine
longswords sometimes worn by the paladins of Sacred Haven.~
