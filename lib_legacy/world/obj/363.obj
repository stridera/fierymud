crate giant wooden~
This giant crate is made of wooden planks.  It looks like it was made
by someone who didn't exactly know what he was doing.  There are gaps
between some of the planks and some of the nails are bent.  But, it 
functions quite well as a crate.~

spetum spear long-narrow-point-barbs~
The spetum is a vastly improved spear.  It has a long narrow blade with two
projections below the thrusting blade which are used to catch an opponent's
weapons and disarm her.  However, the spetum is much heavier than a normal
spear.~
