coracle small-bowl-shaped-watercraft boat~
This small watercraft is oval-shaped, with a single small bench in the middle.
It is constructed of a round frame of branches over which the skins of buffalo
have been stretched.  It looks like it's limited to a single human-sized
occupant.  The bottom is stained much darker than the rest, apparently due to
the body of water in which it has spent much time: Black Lake.    ~

porcupine-quill long-sharp-quill feather~
It's an extra-long quill from the back of an Eldorian Porcupine.  Though
extremely painful when jabbed into bare flesh, young punk sorcerers use these
as quills for scribing spells.  Being thinner than a bird feather, they make
impressive, spidery-looking letters but also break more easily.~
