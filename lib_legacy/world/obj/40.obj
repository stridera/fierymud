Crafted from a solid shard of hardened night, the ring refuses to let even
light caress it.  The band is thin yet does not seem weak by far.  A small
place at the top feels very thick and round.  At a straight look it is almost
like one could see movement from inside.~

lyre saung exquisite black-gold-harp~
As best as you can tell, this instrument is a harp of some kind.  It is
C-shaped, like the stave of a bow, with the wide mouth of the arc completely
open.  The bottom of the arc is a fat, wide base, anchoring 16 strings which
run from base to midsection of the harp.  It is lacquered black, capped on each
end with gold, and highly decorated with cords which help tighten and tune the
strings.~
