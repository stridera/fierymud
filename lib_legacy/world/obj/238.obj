This ring is very beautiful.  The diamond is a rare blue color, accented by the
platinum it is set in.  Faint outlines of a swirling cloud motif add texture to
the ring, though barely enough to notice.  It looks like it was made for a
lady's hand...  A very wealthy lady's hand.~

A slender golden band with delicate whorls of knotwork is the setting for a
rather remarkable gem.  Though it is a small sapphire, no bigger than a wheat
kernel, it is shaped into the form of a hawk descending onto ints prey, talons
outsretched.  It was surely crafted by magic, for what gemcrafter, no matter
how skilled, could perfectly replicate something that small and detailed?~

Its miniscule arms have hexagonal symmetry, and it is very detailed.~

a pale dragon done in metallic thread shimmering in the light, standing rampant
with a five-taloned foot raised as if in greeting.  The dragon looks, as

A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable

catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    ~

bullets bullet silver pirate dakhod-bullets~
A silvery bullet lies here, inscribed with the pirate symbol of
skull-and-crossbones.  The faint smell of sulphur wafts up from it as a
testament to the black powder inside its shell.  Being made of silver, it
should be especially powerful against lycanthropes.  A tiny "D" is engraved on
the flat end.    ~

pistol pirate flintlock pirate-pistol dakhod-pistol~
This pistol is rougly the size of a child's arm, with a solid silver handle to
grip it by inlaid with skulls and fitting your grip quite comfortably.  The
flintlock itself is clean and looks like it would fire quickly.  The long steel
barrel is slightly stained black from the powder used to fire it.  Such a
weapon would be extremely dangerous if used improperly.  Engraved on one end of
the barrel is the name "Dakhod".    ~

cutlass silver pirate boarding pirate-cutlass dakhod-cutlass~
Curving gracefully from hilt to tip, this cutlass is a work of art.  Its
flaring guard is inlaid with silver skulls so that the poor soul at the
receiving end can see his macabre demise before meeting his fate.  Razor-sharp
and very dangerous-looking, it would probably cut through a normal pirate sash
if its owner were not careful.  The hilt is set with a large black diamond, and
looking closely into the depths of the gem you can see the blurry shape of
letters, forming the word "Dakhod".    ~

earring golden hoop hoop-earring pirate dakhod-earring~
A thin golden hoop, this earring would look perfect on a pirate.  Slender and
yet strong, masculine and yet flamboyant, the earring would look simply dashing
on the right person.  It shines even in dim light as though it was polished
recently.  In script so small it can hardly be seen, the name "Dakhod" is
inscribed near the hilt.    ~

hat brown tattered tricorn three-cornered three cornered pirate dakhod-hat~
A well-worn and tattered pirate hat, this nifty three-cornered hat sweeps up at
the front and has a faintly embroidered skull and crossbones on it.  Made of a
soft brown felt, this hat would be protective in both sun and rain, not to
mention in salty sea spray.  It has a fringe of brown feathers that are mostly
worn away, and inside the front brim is the faded name "Dakhod" written in
black ink.    ~

slipper silver buckled pirate silver-buckled dakhod-slipper~
A pair of soft, velvety slippers with silver buckles is here, waiting for their
owner.  The left one is cleverly modified to fit a round peg leg while still
looking identical to the right slipper unless one peeks closely.  The look
quite flashy and are surely the envy or pirates everywhere.  Embroidered in the
inner heel of the right slipper is the name "Dakhod".    ~

Gleaming brightly as though recently polished with oil, the hook looks at once
sharp and deadly, yet it holds a beauty of form unlike anything else could.  
Made of the finest silver, it would surely take a pirate's hoard to commission
something like this.  Engraved on the metal cuff is the name "Dakhod".    ~

A stump of oak is fashioned into a replacement limb.  Weathered by much use,
the bottom is scratched and rounded as if it has scrambled upon a pirate deck
for many years.  Despite many scars of this nature, it seems very well made and
looks like it would support the weight of even a portly pirate.    ~

black eyepatch pirate dakhod-eyepatch~
A thin string of braided silk is the tie for this fashionable eyepatch.  It
looks like it would fit perfectly over an eye socket, whether to conceal a
missing orb or to act as a disguise.  A single silver thread is sewn into the
inner side of the patch, in the shape of the name "Dakhod".    ~
