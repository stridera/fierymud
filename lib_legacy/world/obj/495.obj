sword black-ice-sword dim-blade~
The blade is light, even though this is a long-sword.  A fine edge and a
leather wrapped handle.  The blade is a dim black, excellent to remove glare if
one were in need to sneak.~

dagger black-ice-dagger knife~
Small but solid, this little dagger with its blackened blade seems like it
could do some tragic damage.  A hand-wound leather handle allows a firm grip on
the blade, and being black there would be no shine even during light.~

flail black-ice-flail shadow-ball-chain~
Light but sturdy this flail is viewed anything but worthless.  Even spikes
reach from atop the handle to bash an enemy that is to close for the spike.  
The spike is quite a large ball of protruding lengthy and wide needles, close
to a spear tip.  All black, at night one may not even see the weapon coming.~
