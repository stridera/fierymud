At first glance, these lenses don't seem to have much of a purpose.  A
prismatic chitinous stick hangs off one side like the handle on opera glasses
or a masquerade mask, yet the lenses still have arms to hold them in place
above the ears like spectacles The glass is of uneven thickness and shape, not
conforming to any specific geometry.  Only by holding them up to your eyes and
looking through them can you begin to see the subtle refraction of magical
energies the lenses detect.~
