potion small-healing-potion small-clay-healing-potion magic~
This small clay seems anti-climatic for a healing potion though quite
suitable for a bandage.  It's doubtful that anything inside could save your
life. Though it seems the only real way to find out what magic is contained in
side would be to quaff it.~
