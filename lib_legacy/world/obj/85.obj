sickle~
This farm implement seems somehow more sinister than other sickles. Its
shaft is made of wood, with two sections wrapped in thongs. The blade is
quite long and similar in shape to a scimitar. It protrudes out from the
shaft quite some distance, then rounds back towards it in a vicious curve.
Overall, it seems like quite a clumsy weapon, but wielded properly, it
could do great damage.~
