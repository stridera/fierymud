This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.~

This choker is made of the finest platinum links, like light chainmail.
Somewhat larger links around its upper and lower edges have mounts in which
large diamonds have been affixed.  They are clear and beautiful, and each one
is the size of a pea.  Between these rings, the bulk of the choker's surface is
entirely covered in small black onyxes.  They are polished to a brilliant
shine.~

This is a tiny glass vial, stoppered at the top with a glob of blackened wax.
Dark gray gases swirl slowly inside.  Due to the hardness of the wax, it would
