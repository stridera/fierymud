Though they are indeed solid black leather, these gloves appear to be covered
in thick smoke which emanates from the pores of their surface.  The effect of
the distortion from the smoke is akin to a heatwave passing through the desert.
Although by appearances they should offer little in the way of protection,
these gloves boast the strength and resilience of the demon whose skin they
were made from.~

chafing.  With some of the links tapered at the end of the skirt, the mail

in the shoulders with leather on the underside, it affords one the benefits of
heavy armor without having to burden the wearer's encumbrance.  Trailing off
the shoulders near the neck opening and down the backside of the breastplate,
are two razor-sharp prongs that join near the center of the back.~

Rarer than the finest ivory, this dagger inherits all the favorable qualities
of its dragonbone material.  Curving slightly from tip to grip, the talon is
fantastically smooth, unscratchable by mere mortal weapons.  Somehow a
blood-groove has been carved into the backside of the talon, running from the
razor-sharp tip to the linen wrapped around the hilt end.  The linen is
bloodstained by the talon's victims, and seems continually wet with the
lifeblood harvested from the blood-groove.  The talon has been cut and polished
at the end of the grip, and an elaborate symbol has been engraved on the face.~

thin and exquisitely shined, yet feels as strong and durable as the toughest of
steels.  Each plate forming the breastplate slightly overlaps the next, forming
a flexible yet protective mesh of celestial armor.  Simple clasps of the same
almost-weightless metal attach straps from the front plates to similar plates
in the back.  A thin halo of light surrounds the platemail, slightly hazing the
gleaming metal surface.  Surely the bearer of this armor has the favor of the
gods.~

Its vaporous form has no particular mass or substance, instead a seemingly

skull tiny-dragon-skull small-white translucent-skull~
Humming with magical power it resonates on a primal level.  This skull must
have belonged to a baby dragon or have been shrunken by some great magic maybe
both?  Its neutral power appears to trail out looking for some other power to
mingle and mix with.~

burning-demon-eyes~
A pair of demonic-looking eyes, dark-rimmed and loathsome, burn here with a
flame that is not borne of wood.  No heat rises from the fire that engulfs the
orbs, and they are not held onto the face by any kind of strings or supports,
instead hovering before the eyes and infecting all the wearer sees with a
flaming malevolence.~

ring crystalline-flower-ring delicate-ring small-flower-crystal SpecialEQ~
This ring has a slight glow.  The flower which is magically attached to the
band is made of crystal.  The band itself is a pale jade, carved perfectly to
fit a slender finger.  There is a magical power about it would cause the ring
to react badly to the wrong kinds of people.  It has a beautiful quality and
glow about it, which no doubt helps the person wearing the ring to be stronger
and gives them a special, friendly quality.    ~
