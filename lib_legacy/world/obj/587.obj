wishing well stone fountain~
It's made of polished cream-grey stones cobbled together into
a cylindrical shape. Though it's not very large, it's probably
more than able to handle the water demands of the compound it
calls home. When you lean over and look inside it, you can
see sparkling water far below.~

canteen~
You behold a simple circular shape held rigid with boiled leather
straps that support some kind of oiled canvas that probably holds
water. A stopper on the canteen's mouth keeps the liquid inside
from spilling. The maker of this container has thoughtfully
included straps for easy carrying.~

bran muffin~
A small, vaguely cylindrical shape, this cupcake-like muffin smells
of dates, of nuts, and of simple stone-ground wheat flour. It's
probably very filling and might even help with that regularity
problem you've been having!~

box lunch meat cheese bread~
A thin wooden box with a lid reveals all manner of delicious
lunch type foods! Rolled up slices of smoked meats rest alongside
thick slabs of hard white cheese, which in turn lie beside a few
pieces of hard tack bread.~

pouch cloth~
It's just a simple woolen pouch. The fabric is dyed a brilliant
red color, and there's some embroidery on its front. A cord closes
around the pouch's neck; the cord is quite long, long enough for
you to tie its ends around your belt.~
E
embroidery~
The embroidery is of a strange kind. Usually embroidery is of
pretty things, for some sort of informative or decorative purpose,
but this picture is of a monstrous golden wolf-like beast with
eerily human eyes.~

wind-chimes windchimes~
These wind chimes are thin metal rods hung in graduated descending lengths,
dangling from a single circular disc.  The peeling of these chimes is light and
soft, adding a tintinnabulation to the air like the twinkling of stars at
night.~
