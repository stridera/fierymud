liath-feather long-grey-feather long-gray-feather~
A wing feather from the rare gray liath, this quill is nearly a foot long.  
Prized by artisans and mages alike, it is in high demand as a scribing quill,
especially for water-based spells as it comes from a seabird.  The feathers are
also supposed to be lucky!~
