The book is large and heavy, and is sealed with red wax.  Large, golden words
are set in its cover.  There is a tingling sensation as you touch this tome,
making you realise that this must be a book of power.  One of its stories tells
of a visit from a band of powerful sorcerers who were impressed with Neris'
kindness and presented her with a holy scarab that has some power to it.  The
leader of the sorcerers is shown speaking aloud to Neris refering to her as
"Neris'Kaan", or "Neris the Kind".~
