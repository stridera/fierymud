bat-tooth-necklace sharp teeth~
When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

heavy-rock-neckguard neck-guard tough-stone~
The rock neckguard appears to be chipped and sculpted from a single large
stone.  Previously constructed for the huge Bozaks, it is almost too large for
your neck.  The neckguard is sturdy enough to withstand almost any attack.~

quidnatta-hide-buckler crude-buckler skins strange-animals~
The buckler is made from the skins of multiple quidnattas, each held together
by the barbs of some strange urchin.  The back of the shield is supported by a
conglomeration of wood and stone structures.  The shield is extremely large and
you can hardly see over it.~

spear giant-wooden-spear awkward-spear huge~
The giant wooden spear is definitely made for an extremely strong predator.  
It is crudely made and almost dull, but its sheer size and weight make it a
lethal weapon.  The entire length of the spear is streaked from its last kill.~

The coral ring seems totally flawless.  It is made of the finest coral you have
ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white on the other.  It
is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance so that it is not the
least bit abrasive.~

The pool is fed by the occasional drip of water from the ceiling. The
entire edge of the pool is surrounded with the bones of recent kills,
but the water itself seems perfectly clean and clear. The inhabitants
of the cave must take extremely good care of this water supply.~

The giant archway must weigh tons and you have a hard time imaging
a being large or strong enough to create such a heavy structure. 
It dominates this part of the cavern and dwarf the huts scattered

This giant stone structure has been here for mellinia
yet no one knows how it got here.  It pulsates with
energy and within the arch there is a reflective 
magical surface that undulates like quicksilver.
Perhaps you should enter it.

armor calian plate mail calian-plate-mail kardes_unique_rename_of_elias black shadow~
As your eyes focus on the darkness, it resolves itself into a shape: a set of
fine plate armor.  Looking closer, it seems more and more solid the closer you
look, until you can make out even the tiny details of its forging: flame marks,
tiny rivulets of a darker black, and almost imperceptible silver runes which
cover it and catch what light escapes the deep shadows.  Power pulses from it,
and it seems quite ancient.    ~
