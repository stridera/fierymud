heart-ocean deep-blue-diamond silver-necklace questobject~
This deep, dark blue diamond in a silver filigree setting has an obvious
supernatural quality to it.  The inner minerals of the gemstone seem to slosh
and swirl as it moves, almost like the gem was made of water.  It is set in a
fine silver chain encrusted with tiny sparkling white diamonds, reflecting
dazzling light in all directions.  This exquisite necklace must be worth a
fortune!~
