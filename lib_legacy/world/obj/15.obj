ring soul gem valuable soul-gem wof-clan-item~
   A large purple gem is set on a polished silver band.  There appears to be a
small storm raging inside of the gem, and you become slightly transfixed by it.
A feeling of protectiveness washes over you, and you feel that losing this ring
would be the end of your life.    ~

fountain stone large wof-fountain~
Five uniquely chiseled statues stand in a perfect circle in the middle of the
fountain.  The five beings stand back to back touching at the shoulders.  A
figure of a charismatic druidess, an image of a terrifying dark warrior, the
visage of a cunning ranger, an engraving of a stern priestess, and a carving of
a twisted sorceress make up the body of the fountain.  Water flows from spouts
below each statues feet into the trough encircling the circle of figures.    ~
E
engraving priestess stern~
The image of Cerworn is one of a compassionate but serious woman, her eyes
fixed steadily on an image you cannot see.  Her face is fixed in a gentle but
firm motherly expression, a reflection of her beliefs in loving control.  The
priestess is shown to be wearing a simple white dress, her hands folded in
prayer.    ~
E
figure charismatic druidess~
   Tall, but slim, Janara is a beautiful half-elf with long flowing auburn hair
that reaches down to her waist.  Green foliage is wrapped around her exposing
bits of tanned flesh, but covering up the essentials.  A large anaconda is
wrapped around her body, with its head held by her hand, mouth wide open.    ~
E
image terrifying warrior~
A creature of pure and unadulterated evil, Nuggz stands in an intimidating
stance, ready to bash anything that comes his way.  He wears a permanent scowl
on his face, the product of years of living a corrupted life style.    ~
E
visage cunning ranger~
Wehr is leaning on a longbow, his hair long and wild looking.  A gentle
expression on his face makes you relax, and feel all warm inside.  His eyes
seem to be fixed directly upon you, and you feel as if your soul is being
looked at.  A small wolf is standing next to him, looking up into his face as
if asking for direction.    ~
E
carving twisted sorceress~
Glimmering silver hair falls down to the shoulders of this otherwise beautiful
sorceress.  Cold piercing blue eyes indicate that Krytonius is not as nice as
she looks.    ~

egg copper-tinged shulien-egg~
The shell is leathery and tough, but it lacks the warm pulse of life one
expects from a living egg.  Though its species can only be guessed at, it is
probably something that will grow up to be large in size.  The egg itself looks
to be made of copper metal, though its leathery skin feels nothing like metal.
It looks quite heavy, though, since it is about as large as the average gnome.
