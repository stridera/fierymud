gold fountain milk~
A small marble fountain streaked with gold sits in the corner, magically
flowing with fresh, warm milk.  It smells excellent and would perfectly
complement everything from cereal to cookies.  An inscription at the bottom
says "Guardians of Truth, 2006".    ~

poupelin pastry~
Made of a thin dough with a partridge inside (feet sticking up) and including
such other ingredients as nutmeg, ginger, chopped marjoram, new butter, and
saffroned sour lemon slices, the poupelin is a legendary pastry.  The secrets
of its baking are only known to a select few in the world.  Such a pastry is
truly a work of art!    ~

blueberry slice pie~
Crispy browned crust sprinkled with sugar lines the hot blueberry filling of
this freshly sliced pie.  It would probably burn one's mouth and stain it
purple with the hot berry juice, but that's half the fun, isn't it?    ~

Tasty and delicious, the cream puff would go well with coffee.  Light and
fluffy but filled with thick cream, the cream puff is a standard of pastry

This is just a plain pair of glasses until worn.  Once placed over the eyes,
they begin to glow with a golden light and transform into a thin line of energy
that hums for a moment and then seemingly vanishes except for a small glyph
representing "Truth" that can be seen deep in the pupils of the wearer.    ~
