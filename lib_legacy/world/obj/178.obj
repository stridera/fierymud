The spear is nothing more than a stick with a flint head tied at one end.  It
is rather badly made and doesn't have a good balance.~

The mask shimmers slightly as you hold it up and you see yourself reflected.  
There seems to be a subtle difference between what you see and how you remember
yourself to appear to others.  Perhaps this is the real you.~

obscure petroglyph petroglyphs symbols~
Small symbols carved into the rock are barely visible below the water.  One is
a four-pointed sun symbol, and below it is an inverted triangle with circles on
each of its sides.  Beneath the sun are even smaller letters that say "The
Canyon, by Timun circa 1993" and beneath the triangle it says "Escape route by
Kourrya circa 2006".    ~

pool moss-covered hidden moss-covered-pool~
A small pool is hidden from plain sight behind a large rock here.  The water is
cold, but moss and lichens grow in abundance around it.  It is much deeper than
it first appears - the bottom of the pool cannot be reached, even with a long
stick.  On one side of the pool's wall, beneath the water, some obscure
petroglyphs can be seen.    ~
