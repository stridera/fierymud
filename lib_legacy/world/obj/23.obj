untold knowledge of all time.  It can instill purpose to those who are lost,

The ancient children of the earth mother labored hard, creating a network of
mystical standing stones, columns, and monoliths to better commune with
nature. These powerful stones mark mystical spots of serenity, places where
a follower of nature can speak with the earth mother and those spirits who
follow her guidance. For this reason, an initiate of the faith must visit the
four greatest of these creations, with there being in existance one each
to the north, east, south, and west. At each, the phrase of devotion must
be spoken, by one true of heart and mighty enough to pierce the veil of
nature: 'I pray for a blessing from mother earth, creator of life and bringer
of death'.
 
Once all these blessing are collected and presented before the high druid, the
young devotee will be richly rewarded.~
