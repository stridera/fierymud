cloak tattered-wolf-fur-cloak tattered-pile-fur~
The cloak is heavy and looks very warm, except for some ripped spots. The 
holes might have come from some sharp object, and though it's been 
carefully cleaned, probably by some freezing soldier, you can see the 
remains of bloodstains around the holes' edges. You consider wearing it 
yourself, since it still looks somewhat servicable.~

As you look at the tapestry, your spirit rises from the sublime colors and
expert weaving of the piece, then falls, as you notice how ragged its edges
are, and how obviously neglected it is.  There's no way it can be repaired, you
see.  That's too bad.  If it were in better shape, it'd be worthy of a lord's
castle.  You might even want to put it in yours, if you ever get one.~

It's a lot bigger than a normal barrel. It seems to have the sole 
function of collecting snow and melting it for drinking. The fire nearby 
seems to facilitate the melting. It's made of cheap, thrown-together tin. 
You have no idea how it even holds liquid. There's an inscription on its 
side.~

do look effective in helping you traverse the killingly cold snow of the arctic
fields -- and they might protect you a little bit too.~

mace broken-dragon's-fist-mace broken-dragons-fist-mace~
You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far from
here.  It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much lighter, lucky
for you!  The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's slightly clenched
clawed forefoot.  But it's fallen on hard times--its handle is broken, and its
surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft and balance.  It's still quite
usable, though no experienced warrior would be interested in wielding it, since
its power is greatly reduced because of its condition.  But a junior trainee
would be thrilled to have this once-impressive weapon.~

The book is leatherbound, and masterfully made, with thick paper pages. 
Written there, in flowing, well-trained script, you read:

   Day 22, Month of the Winter Wolf
   My men go out today to battle the Frost Elves across the mountains. I do 
   not know how to prepare my troops. Yesterday, Lady Rill sent her Amazons 
   to assist me in Queen Serazais' mad quest, but I do not know if even 
   they will make much difference in this fight. We are outnumbered. That 
   obscene little man Serazais sent me, that outlander necromancer, last 
   night cast a spell he said would protect us, but I don't believe it'll 
   work. Ah!-- I hear the war-trumpets. Pray to whatever gods you pray to 
   that at least some of us will return alive, my dearest Thraja.

This is the last entry in the book. You see no further entries in the 
beautifully crafted journal. ~
