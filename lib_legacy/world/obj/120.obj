This little creek is cut off at both ends by decades or more
of brambles decomposing into the niggardly soil. The water 
has a greenish film across its surface, though that is easily
swept aside to reach the liquid beneath the algae.~

passion fruit purple~
This fruit is about the size of a plum, with a hard rind that,
once broken, reveals sweet, nearly alcoholic-tasting orange-pink
flesh. Though it isn't large, fruit is supposed to be very good
for growing adventurers, so eat up!~

to put onto a lady's charm bracelet.  It dangles from a bit of chain, but not
enough to wear around your neck, which is not a surprise.~

The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over time, the color
was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light brown.  It's a simple two-piece
conical sort of hood, coming to a point well above the wearer's crown and
falling back.  A lively tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.~

These cups fit exactly around their wearer's shoulder, protecting it from the

with only an embossing around their edges as decoration.  Leather straps hold
the spaulders tight against the shoulders and down part of the arm,
criss-crossing at the chest and back.~

This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.~

This is no ordinary cape -- it's that special kind used in swordplay.  A fabric
handle is sewn into its center, making it obvious that you hold it there.  
Those swirling folds of black and white satin would easily confound an
opponent, allowing you to seize their weapon in the satin.~

against blows, sinewy for strength, and dense burr-like material to slow
punctures.  On top of each forearm is the symbol of the Rhell tree: a large
round flower with milky-white petals.  In addition, a single droplet of fluid
is just falling from the tip of the lowest petal on each flower.    ~
