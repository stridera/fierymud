It is a worn but serviceable pickaxe with a leather-covered wooden handle.  
Blades polished to a brilliant gleam, it looks like it has been cared for
lovingly by the dwarf who last owned it.  Near where the blade connects to the
shaft there is a maker's mark etched into the metal.~

The maker's mark is a mountain with a tiered city, showing that it's from
Anduin.  Below it is a line of runes reading "Jasper Ironfeld 464".    ~

an old, rusty chest~
An old chest gathers dust here.~
This wooden chest is old.  A slight mold is growing on the wood and the iron
parts are rusted, probably because it is so close to the water.  It looks like
it is bolted into the stone with heavy iron bolts, but why would anyone go to
such trouble?    ~

Perhaps the size of a dwarf's thumbnail, this rock glints with a hidden value.
Under all that dirt, it appears to be a rough diamond!  What a fortuitous
discovery!  This would probably sell for a lot of money if the right buyer
could be found, but as it is now it needs a little polish and faceting before
it could be quite as valuable.    ~

Heavy and sharp, it gleams with the polish of a well-loved weapon and would be
quite deadly to bare stone, trees, and anything else the owner would see fit to
use it on.  Near the haft, a few dwarven runes are inscribed, which read "Onyx
Stonehelm".~

This is a pair of fine goggles, made of expertly tanned leather and lenses of
thick glass.  Excellent for protecting the eyes from the loose dust and
occasional hazards in a mine, they would probably also be useful outdoors in a
sandstorm, though underwater use would probably ruin the leather and is not
recommended.~

About two feet long from the tip of the hilt to the midpoint of the blade, the
pickaxe has a sharp, pointy end and a broader, flatter end depending on whether
it is currently being used to make sharp gouges in rock or to scrape away at
it.  It looks quite sharp and could probably be used as a weapon in addition to
a tool.~

Black, cold, and very pure, it is impossible to tell the depth of this pool
just by looking into it due to the absolute clarity of the water.  It has a
slight current coming from a crack in the northern wall and leading down a
small fissure at the other end of the pool.  The water itself is icy-cold and
has probably never seen the sun.    ~

This short length of rope looks like it has seen better days.  Made of a thick

support much weight.  Still, it would probably be quite useful in tying
something up.    ~

This stone basin is made of a polished black granite and looks functional
rather than decorational, though like all stonework made by dwarves it has its
own beauty, looking like it was coaxed from the stone itself rather than made
somewhere else and placed here.  The water is clear and cold.  Down underneath
the basin is a little stream formed by the runoff that the creatures of the
cave use as a water source, coming up to it to drink.  It was certainly
considerate of the dwarves to take the natural ecology of the mine into account
when they placed the basin here.    ~
