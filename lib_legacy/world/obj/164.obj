arch portal emerald~
An emerald green portal pulses with energy, as if it is the gateway to
greater, or safer, things. Between its flares of brilliance, you can see what
looks like a destroyed chapel. Perhaps the one within the keep...~

   A massive stone arch that nearly touches the high ceiling of the chapel.  
Steps lead up to the arch as though you could walk through but it only leads to
the wall behind it...    ~

stone portal arch~
   This stone portal seems inactive now and is covered in the dried blood and
bones of those souls who braved to come here before you.  Since it's inactive
now there must be another way out.    ~

portal glowing brightly stone~
   This portal looks quite ancient and is covered in a fine dusty powder.  
Although it is quite active it looks as though this room hasn't been disturbed
for quite some time.  The silvery glow of the portals surface ripples to your
touch and feels strangely cold...    ~
