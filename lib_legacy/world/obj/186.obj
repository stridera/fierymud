desk child child-sized small~
This is a small child's desk which would generally be found in any school
house.  The lid of the desk seems battered with the usual dings and scrapes a
child would incur upon upon their property.  The lid squeaks slightly when
opened and the hinges bare a bit of rust.  One of the four otherwise sturdy
legs is shorter than the others making the desk wobble slightly.    ~

pencil graphite small stubby~
This is what remains of an already short graphite pencil.  It may have been
chewed on in the past but is so stubby and short from continued sharpening that
evidence of teeth-marks is gone.    ~

apple teacher's teacher shiny red food~
This is a highly polished shiny red apple which was, at least at one time, a
present from a pupil to teacher.  The high level of polish may suggest the
student brought the apple in reparation for some past transgression, however
the sheen is marred by a small worm hole near the stem.    ~

desk teacher's teacher oblong~
This desk is much longer and wider than those of the students who populate the
school house.  This desk clearly belongs to the teacher of the class and has a
few papers scattered about it along with a small ink-well and quill pen.  The
desk is in near-mint condition with few flaws and appears to have been
well-kept since its construction.  There is a small keyhole on the center
drawer.  The feet of the desk appear to have been afixed to the floorboards.  ~

broom crooked handle~
This broom has seen better times.  The once illustrious broom is now missing
more than half of the brush and the handle has been warped crooked from
continued use.  Not only has the handle bent but it has grown nasty possessing
many sharp little splinters!    ~

key desk teacher's odd odd-shaped gray~
This key is an odd shape.  Viewed from the front end the key appears to be
triangular, however when viewed from the side there are strange gaps amid the
center section of the key.  The color is also abnormal and appears to shift
from a solid matte black to a more translucent gray with an ethereal misty
quality to it.  The key is held on a slender thong of leather about the right
size to be worn around a human neck.    ~
