trickle merry water~
It looks like part of an underground stream, or perhaps there is a nearby
spring.  At any rate, it flows from the earth at about waist height.  Directly
beneath it is a shelf of granite, obviously installed there.  The water falls
over the shelf, then flows east along a groove in the floor.    ~

This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light
is so bright as to hurt the eyes, yet it is only a bit warm to the touch.  
Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead
of glass.    ~

Like a massive sentinel, this standing stone towers over its surroundings.  It
stands perhaps fifteen feet tall, and is five feet across.  It appears to have
been shaped into a cylinder, and its presence here is obviously no accident.  
Most of it is weathered, but high up on top, there seems to be a small
depression that looks recently carved.  Bits of soot sit in the depression,
which appears to have been singed in several spots, as if by intense heat.~

gracefully inward beneath the perfectly-straight cross-webs.  It shimmers as
the light hits it with subtle iridescence.  The strands appear gossamer-thin.

little light penetrates the trees above is reflected from its razor-thin

This is a six-foot length of dull black links.  The dark, sullen metal from
which they were forged reflects little light.  The links are nearly
rectangular, and lie almost flat due to a clever design.  The claw at the end
is rectangular as well, except that its pointed tine juts outward at a small
angle.  The claw is perhaps double the size of a link.  Stains and scratches
abound on this weapon.~
