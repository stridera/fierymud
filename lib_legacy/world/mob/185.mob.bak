the Abbot~
An old man walks past, keeping an eye on his monks.
~
A balding old man with a slight hunch in his back wanders about, keeping an eye
on his monks.  His rich robes and small spectacles makes him seem wise and
learned.  The Abbot is fairly tall and handsome to be cooped up in an abbey all
the time.

prior berack man~
the Prior~
A displeased-looking old man walks around grumbling.
~
Of all the spiritual people in a position of power, this one seems least
relaxed.  Berack seems absolute about acquiring some objective to make his life
complete, and would probably stop at nothing to achieve his means.  He is gruff
and not as cleanly shaven as one might expect a prior to be.
