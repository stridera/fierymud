A Dirt Trail~
   A barely discernible cut of some kind leads off the main road and into the
dense forest to the southwest.  It seems this path was only recently
re-discovered, judging by the freshness of the footprints of humanoids leading
through the dirt.~

An Ancient Avenue~
   An overgrown wide path or road of some kind leading east and west cuts
through the ancient deciduous forest.  A towering standing stone at the west
end of the path marks this as some kind of ancient avenue, a ritual walkway or
processional between two important places.  Though the low lying vegetation
covering the ground is relatively undisturbed, the depressions of two narrow
channels, like ditches or trenches, leading to small embankments run along the
north and south edges of the path, marking a boundary with the forest.  The
east end of the avenue is lost from view as the forest has completely overgrown
it.~

Before an Enormous Standing Stone~
   Amongst the trees beside the ancient avenue is an enormous standing stone.
The trees here seem to have grown around the menhir, indicating the stone must
be older than the forest.  A larger number of floating lights gather around the
menhir from time to time, slowly flickering in and out of existence.  From
here, it becomes clear the avenue originally continued to the west, but now the
path lays blocked with fallen debris.  Sounds of animals small and large
emanate from all around and more floating lights are visible in all directions.
In the distance to the west, you can make out seems to be a large clearing in
the forest.~

An Overgrown Forest~
   Low hills press up against the eastern and southern edges of the forest.  
The dense undergrowth and fallen trees make finding paths into and through the
forest extremely challenging.  Wind rustles through the leaves of trees that
must be many hundreds of years old, shaking branches and eliciting the cries of
birds from far overhead.  From the noises of birds to the sound of larger
creatures stalking through the underbrush, it's clear this forest is very old
and very alive.  If the wandering lights deeper amongst the trees are any
indication, this place is very magical too.~

A Dense Forest Maze~
   Towering ancient trees grow all around, creating a dense verdant canvas in
all directions.  Earthy smells seep up from the ground where your feet fall,
enhanced by the rich scent of the trees.  From the tops of the trees above,
calls of birds are carried down by beams of light which penetrate the dense
canopy.  A powerful chthonic energy reverberates throughout the forest,
emanating from every tree and every rock.  Out of the corner of your eye, you
catch glimpses of flickering lights and moving shadows, as if something wild
and dangerous lurks just beyond the periphery.  From all directions echo sounds
of creatures prowling through the darkness.  No clear trail gives any guidance
through the disorienting trees and unnerving noises.~

A Dense Forest Maze~
   Towering ancient trees grow all around, creating a dense verdant canvas in
all directions.  Earthy smells seep up from the ground where your feet fall,
enhanced by the rich scent of the trees.  From the tops of the trees above,
calls of birds are carried down by beams of light which penetrate the dense
canopy.  A powerful chthonic energy reverberates throughout the forest,
emanating from every tree and every rock.  Out of the corner of your eye, you
catch glimpses of flickering lights and moving shadows, as if something wild
and dangerous lurks just beyond the periphery.  From all directions echo sounds
of creatures prowling through the darkness.  No clear trail gives any guidance
through the disorienting trees and unnerving noises.~

The End of an Ancient Avenue~
   An overgrown wide path or road of some kind leading east and west cuts
through the ancient forest.  Though the low lying vegetation covering the
ground is relatively undisturbed, the depressions of two narrow channels, like
ditches or trenches, leading to small embankments run along the north and south
edges of the path, marking a clear boundary to the forest.  You see now the
avenue actually leads to a second circle of smaller standing stones arranged on
the top of a wide hill in the middle of the forest just to the west of you.  
To the east, the avenue is clogged with old debris.~

Depression depressions channel channels ditch ditches trench trenches embankment embankments~
The channels here are barely noticeable with all the groundcover and grasses 
growing over them.  Since this path seems to predate the use of roads in South 
Caelia, it's unlikely these are gutters.  Most likely they served as a trail marker or 
something more ceremonial to delineate between the cultivated and the wild.~

debris~
Over the centuries, branches and trees have fallen over the avenue, making the 
path impassable.  It would take an extraordinary amount of work to clear the 
avenue again.~

birds from far overhead.  From the noises of birds to the sound of larger

   Looping the hilltop clearing is a faded overgrown footpath of some kind.  
The path connects four smaller menhir which form a circle around a large
central stone at the apex of the hill.  From the path, the sky is visible, the
result of a clear delineation between the forest and the circle of stones.  
Very recent footprints are clearly visible in the packed down dirt.  Beyond the

A Dense Forest Maze~
   Towering ancient trees grow all around, creating a dense verdant canvas in
all directions.  Earthy smells seep up from the ground where your feet fall,
enhanced by the rich scent of the trees.  From the tops of the trees above,
calls of birds are carried down by beams of light which penetrate the dense
canopy.  A powerful chthonic energy reverberates throughout the forest,
emanating from every tree and every rock.  Out of the corner of your eye, you
catch glimpses of flickering lights and moving shadows, as if something wild
and dangerous lurks just beyond the periphery.  From all directions echo sounds
of creatures prowling through the darkness.  No clear trail gives any guidance
through the disorienting trees and unnerving noises.~

The Inner Circle Path~
   Looping the hilltop clearing is a faded overgrown footpath of some kind.  
The path connects four smaller menhir which form a circle around a large
central stone at the apex of the hill.  From the path, the sky is visible, the
result of a clear delineation between the forest and the circle of stones.  
Very recent footprints are clearly visible in the packed down dirt.  Beyond the
path lies the dark forest, its ominous sounds and twinkling lights still
perceptible.~

footprints~
At first, the prints clearly show they were left by people with booted feet.  
Studying them a moment longer, you realize it wasn't a group of people, but
just a single person, walking constantly in the same direction.  It seems
someone has been constantly walking in a circle along the path, though the
reason is unclear.~
E
trees~
The towering trees are a mix of species, from oak to Rhell.  None of them seem
to be moving of their own volition, but with so many, it's hard to be certain.~
E
lights~
Pale motes of various pastel colors fade into being and slowly vanish.  
Perhaps they're fireflies, but they seem rather large for bugs...~

A Smaller Menhir of the Inner Circle~
   Serving as a kind of anchor point on the inner circle of the hilltop path is
an ancient grey stone.  It stands like some kind of warden between the open
hilltop and the looming forest beyond.  Aligned in a north-eastern direction
from the altar stone, this one overlooks the edge of the hill toward the
ancient avenue and the roads of the Ulgranian Peninsula to the north.  You can
barely make out two much larger stones, one to the north and one to the east.
Footprints cross before the stone before east.~

Among the Standing Stones~
   There is a sense of safety and security out among the standing stones
ringing the hilltop, away from the dangers of the forest.  The gentle slopes of
the hill are covered with soft, verdant grass and small wildflowers, among
which flit tiny lights.  The presence of the spirits is strong in this place,
breathing with untapped potential.  Ringing the standing stones is a path of
some kind, and standing in the center is a large altar slab.~

An Ancient Trod Path~
   From the end of the ancient avenue a faded path leads up the gentle slope of
the hill to a central altar stone.  As you approach, a sense of awe and
grandeur washes over you as the ancient powers of this megalith thrum within
your bones.  Looking back to the east, the cut of the avenue through the forest
stands out more and more, giving a clean line of sight to another monolith far
to the east.  Surely the avenue served to connect the two places.  Around you
stands the open grassy slopes of the hilltop.~

   Serving as a kind of anchor point on the inner circle of the hilltop path is
an ancient grey stone.  It stands like some kind of warden between the open
hilltop and the looming forest beyond.  Aligned in a south-eastern direction
from the altar stone, this one overlooks the edge of the hill toward the
ancient avenue and gives a clear view of the larger range of hills south in the
heart of South Caelia.  You can barely make out two much larger stones, one to
the south nestled against the hills and one to the east.  Footprints cross
before the stone heading south.~

An Overgrown Forest~
   Low hills press up against the eastern and southern edges of the forest.  
The dense undergrowth and fallen trees make finding paths into and through the
forest extremely challenging.  Wind rustles through the leaves of trees that
must be many hundreds of years old, shaking branches and eliciting the cries of
birds from far overhead.  From the noises of birds to the sound of larger
creatures stalking through the underbrush, it's clear this forest is very old
and very alive.  If the wandering lights deeper amongst the trees are any
indication, this place is very magical too.~

   Along the north edge of the forest looms a stone menhir, nearly completely
hidden among the trees.  Some kind of trailing vine has grown up and around the
menhir, encircling it from base to top like something trapped in a spiderweb.
A wider variety of flowering plants grow around the stone as well, making it
stand out among the disorienting sameness of the rest of the forest.  Among the
flowers hover dozens of small gleaming and fading lights, more numerous here
than further off in the maze.~

Among the Standing Stones~
   There is a sense of safety and security out among the standing stones
ringing the hilltop, away from the dangers of the forest.  The gentle slopes of
the hill are covered with soft, verdant grass and small wildflowers, among
which flit tiny lights.  The presence of the spirits is strong in this place,
breathing with untapped potential.  Ringing the standing stones is a path of
some kind, and standing in the center is a large altar slab.~

An Ancient Stone Altar~
   Looking out into the distance from the top of the old hill is like standing
at the nexus of the world, a fulcrum around which all points beyond revolve.  
It stands at the convergence of open sky and firm earth, one swirling above,
the other stirring below.  Here in the center of the barrier formed by the
inner stones, amidst a rolling sea of untapped potential, all things feel
possible.  The rough shapes of the four larger outer menhir are visible in the
forest beyond, directing and focusing the energies of the leylines of the world
to this spot.  That such a place could maintain its power even without regular
tenders speaks to the depth of the energy pooled in this place.  It's no wonder
so many mystical creatures have been drawn to this ancient megalith.~

The Inner Circle Path~
   Looping the hilltop clearing is a faded overgrown footpath of some kind.  
The path connects four smaller menhir which form a circle around a large
central stone at the apex of the hill.  From the path, the sky is visible, the
result of a clear delineation between the forest and the circle of stones.  
Very recent footprints are clearly visible in the packed down dirt.  Beyond the
path lies the dark forest, its ominous sounds and twinkling lights still
perceptible.~

enhanced by the rich scent of the trees.  From the tops of the trees above,
calls of birds are carried down by beams of light which penetrate the dense
canopy.  A powerful chthonic energy reverberates throughout the forest,
emanating from every tree and every rock.  Out of the corner of your eye, you
catch glimpses of flickering lights and moving shadows, as if something wild
and dangerous lurks just beyond the periphery.  From all directions echo sounds
of creatures prowling through the darkness.  No clear trail gives any guidance
through the disorienting trees and unnerving noises.~

   The thicket is larger than it appears, sheltering the den of some wild
beast.  The ground is well worn from trampling and the interior sides of the
brambles are thoroughly, though roughly, manicured.  Bits of white hair snagged
on thorns here and there dot the den.  To the south, the glen is visible.  To
the north, the forest looms, though passage is blocked by the brambles.  East
stands an enormous rough stone pillar.~

Before an Enormous Standing Stone~
   The brambles that make up the southeastern edge of the animal den have grown
up around an ancient standing stone that lays mostly hidden from view by the
huge trees of the forest to the north and east.  The way the menhir is nestled
in the trees indicates the stone was placed here first and the trees slowly
grew up around it.  Tiny lights glow and fade in larger numbers around the
menhir but have no discernable pattern or behavior.  The standing stone also
provides an excellent hiding place from whatever is out there in the forest.~

An Overgrown Forest~
   Low hills press up against the eastern and southern edges of the forest.  
The dense undergrowth and fallen trees make finding paths into and through the
forest extremely challenging.  Wind rustles through the leaves of trees that
must be many hundreds of years old, shaking branches and eliciting the cries of
birds from far overhead.  From the noises of birds to the sound of larger
creatures stalking through the underbrush, it's clear this forest is very old
and very alive.  If the wandering lights deeper amongst the trees are any
indication, this place is very magical too.~

of creatures prowling through the darkness.  No clear trail gives any guidance

A Dense Forest Maze~
   Towering ancient trees grow all around, creating a dense verdant canvas in

enhanced by the rich scent of the trees.  From the tops of the trees above,
calls of birds are carried down by beams of light which penetrate the dense

The Inner Circle Path~
   Looping the hilltop clearing is a faded overgrown footpath of some kind.  
The path connects four smaller menhir which form a circle around a large
central stone at the apex of the hill.  From the path, the sky is visible, the
result of a clear delineation between the forest and the circle of stones.  
Very recent footprints are clearly visible in the packed down dirt.  Beyond the
path lies the dark forest, its ominous sounds and twinkling lights still
perceptible.~

footprints~
At first, the prints clearly show they were left by people with booted feet.  
Studying them a moment longer, you realize it wasn't a group of people, but
just a single person, walking constantly in the same direction.  It seems
someone has been constantly walking in a circle along the path, though the
reason is unclear.~
E
trees~
The towering trees are a mix of species, from oak to Rhell.  None of them seem
to be moving of their own volition, but with so many, it's hard to be certain.~

Pale motes of various pastel colors fade into being and slowly vanish.  
Perhaps they're fireflies, but they seem rather large for bugs...~

A Smaller Menhir of the Inner Circle~
   Serving as a kind of anchor point on the inner circle of the hilltop path is
an ancient grey stone.  It stands like some kind of warden between the open
hilltop and the looming forest beyond.  Aligned in a north-western direction
from the altar stone, this one overlooks the roads of the Ulgranian Peninsula
to the north and gives a view of the distant beaches on the western shores of
South Caelia.  You can barely make out two much larger stones, one to the north
and one to the west deep in the forest.  Footprints cross before the stone
heading north.~

Among the Standing Stones~
   There is a sense of safety and security out among the standing stones
ringing the hilltop, away from the dangers of the forest.  The gentle slopes of
the hill are covered with soft, verdant grass and small wildflowers, among
which flit tiny lights.  The presence of the spirits is strong in this place,
breathing with untapped potential.  Ringing the standing stones is a path of
some kind, and standing in the center is a large altar slab.~

   Serving as a kind of anchor point on the inner circle of the hilltop path is
an ancient grey stone.  It stands like some kind of warden between the open
hilltop and the looming forest beyond.  Aligned in a south-western direction
from the altar stone, from here you can see the larger range of hills south in
the heart of South Caelia and the distant beaches on the western shores.  You
can barely make out two much larger stones, one to the south nestled against
the hills and one to the west deep in the forest.  Footprints cross before the

The Heart of the Den~
   The thicket is larger than it appears, sheltering the den of some wild
beast.  The ground is well worn from trampling and the interior sides of the
brambles are thoroughly, though roughly, manicured.  Bits of white hair snagged
on thorns here and there dot the den.  Filling this section is a matted down
mass of straw and grass, obviously the bed of whatever lives in this den.  
Oddly, loosely arranged around the bed are bunches of flowers.~

like the ones growing in the glade outside.~
E
brambles~
The mesh of thorny vines and leafy shrubs form a particularly thick wall around
the glade.  Some are obviously blackberry, judging from the petite white
flowers and rich, dark berries.  Others are less distinct.~
E
hair~
The hair is coarse and thick, obviously from some kind of wild beast or animal.
Yet it has a pleasing feel to the touch and somehow, it gives you the slightest
sense of serenity and...  Pie?  That can't be right...~

A Small Glade~
   The forest gives way to a small clear space nestled between the towering
trees to the northeast and the foot of the rocky hills to the southwest.  Tall
grasses and beautiful flowers flourish in the open air.  Thick brambles
demarcate the boundary between forest and glade, blocking any glimpse of what
might lay beyond them, save for a single huge standing stone to the northeast.~

A Dense Forest Maze~
   Towering ancient trees grow all around, creating a dense verdant canvas in
all directions.  Earthy smells seep up from the ground where your feet fall,
enhanced by the rich scent of the trees.  From the tops of the trees above,
calls of birds are carried down by beams of light which penetrate the dense
canopy.  A powerful chthonic energy reverberates throughout the forest,
emanating from every tree and every rock.  Out of the corner of your eye, you
catch glimpses of flickering lights and moving shadows, as if something wild
and dangerous lurks just beyond the periphery.  From all directions echo sounds
of creatures prowling through the darkness.  No clear trail gives any guidance
through the disorienting trees and unnerving noises.~

Before an Enormous Standing Stone~
   Deep in the forest maze, completely obscured by the trees around it, stands
an ancient towering menhir.  This menhir is the only sign of anything
resembling a distinct marker or feature you can see in any direction.  The
plants and trees of the forest have slowly grown up and around the menhir over
the ages, indicating the stone was here long before the forest was.  The
spirits of the forest seem to appreciate the place though, as the floating
lights appear in larger numbers around the menhir than elsewhere in the
distance.  However the stone offers no protection from the wild creatures
lurking in these forested depths.~

canopy.  A powerful chthonic energy reverberates throughout the forest,
emanating from every tree and every rock.  Out of the corner of your eye, you
catch glimpses of flickering lights and moving shadows, as if something wild
and dangerous lurks just beyond the periphery.  From all directions echo sounds
of creatures prowling through the darkness.  No clear trail gives any guidance
through the disorienting trees and unnerving noises.~

A Dense Forest Maze~
   Towering ancient trees grow all around, creating a dense verdant canvas in
all directions.  Earthy smells seep up from the ground where your feet fall,
enhanced by the rich scent of the trees.  From the tops of the trees above,
calls of birds are carried down by beams of light which penetrate the dense
canopy.  A powerful chthonic energy reverberates throughout the forest,
