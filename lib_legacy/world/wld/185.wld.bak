Dusty Path~
   The gatehouse to a large, highly decorated monastery lies west along this
path.  The is a small building which appears to have been tacked onto the main
abbey complex just south of here, while there are fields distantly east.

Outside the Gatehouse~
   The gatehouse to the monastery of the Brotherhood of Tisus the Benevolent.
There are heavy wooden doors leading within to the south, into the eroding
marble building.  The wrath of the elements has taken its toll on the building,
especially the brutal winds that sweep passed here from the fields to the east.

   The sacrist does not seem to be here at the moment, though he left the tools
of his trade behind.  A large book has been placed on his desk, documenting the
many funerals that have taken place here over the years.  To the east is the
main, common area of the church.

The Almonry~
   This particular almonry is in poor condition and the thick dust could make
breathing difficult for some.  Jars line the shelves around the room filled
graciously by the monks of the abbey with grains and sugar to be given to weary
travellers as alms.  The almonry is so small that there only seems to be a lone
exit, to the north.

Abbey Gatehouse~
   The gatehouse of the abbey seems well fitted to stand up to any assualt that
any barbarians might launch.  Only a powerful assualt by a large force could
break through the incredibly thick walls of the gatehouse.  The elements of the
world swirl around through the thick oak doors to the north or through to the
south into the insides of the abbey itself.

a position on the west side of the large, open room, facing the door way.  
Next to the alter is a passage leading to an ajoining room.  East there are the

and wide, and the steps of the library are to the south.  The entire building
is large and complex in its simplicity.  Though the years of wind and rain have
been cruel at times, the building is still in remarkable condition.  A small
gate stands to the west, beyond which is a simple dirt road that runs off into
the hills.

Outside the Library~
   The outside in front of the library is as plain as the building which stands
to the south.  The abbey, back to the north, can be reached by crossing a small
stone bridge.  Above there is a bit of open sky that almost seems to be calling
to the birds.  As it is now, those skies are empty, and all that is noticable
is the looming library building.

Outside the Library~
   There is greatness in literature, and the library to the south is rich in
words.  The size of the building is incredible, matched by the abbey to the
north.  Above is open sky, practically devoid of everything.  There is not even
a simple cloud or a single bird to make it more occupied.

order.  This mess will take a long time to sort though and clear up.
