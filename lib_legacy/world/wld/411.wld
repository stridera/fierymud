Near the Breakers~
Salty spray showers on you from all sides as the raging sea booms into
the row of breakers to your north. Turbulent water and a stiff easterly
make passage to the north impossible. You are awed by the strength of
the currents dashing between the boulders with each successive wave. The
narrow safe zone continues to your east or you can climb the lone breaker
blocking your passage south. A sheer cliff soars above your head to an
unknown height.

A Sheltered Cove~
You find yourself squeezed into a narrow, rocky pocket between the rough,
chalky veneer of the cliffs and the craggy face of a lone breaker. Fine-
grained sands slide under foot as you look around. Cool air soothes you
in breath after refreshing breath. Relaxation steals its way into your
tired muscles despite your best efforts at resistance... Closing your eyes,
you note the muted quality of the waves which allows you to hear a faint,
haunting melody drifting past like the memory of a lullaby...

The Sentinel Breaker~
Fish scales and bones litter the top of the breaker. Apparently, this is
a favorite dining spot for some animal feeding from the sea. Looking about,
you can't really blame it. You have a commanding view in four directions and
can easily leap down in any of them -- the shallow breakwaters to the north, 
rocky shallows east and south, or into a sheltered cove to the west.

The Isthmus~
The pile of loose boulders that makes up the isthmus brims against the
peninsula. This spot marks one end of the highest switchback on the 
crude isthmus pathway. You gaze about,taking in the view now afforded you.
The vast ocean grumbles in annoyance to the east. It washes the southern
coastline with a gentler mien. The view north is blocked by a thick growth
of trees and low shrubs. The path continues, in better condition, to the 
west. Glancing down, you see the pathway descending to the shallows.

you are suddenly hit by a burst of empathy that brings you to your knees
in tears. Someone is very powerful and very unhappy. You can enter a more
stable, grassy area to the south, or a wooded area to the east. To the

Small animal bones littered about the floor confirm your suspicions

One wish only asked of thee!
One wish only granted me!
Malicious watcher, cursed be!
No more wishes granted to THEE!

Foul Rowan by Hemlock cleansed,
Ocean's breath sent to avenge,
Sea's rage never bends!
To this madness, bring an end!

Over the Sea~
You hang suspended in the mists. Or are you falling? It's so hard to
tell... Only the wind whistling past your ears gives you any clue about
motion. The mists here swirl with more energy than you've seen elsewhere
and anger overwhelms the sadness. Something very dark looms in the mists
to your east.

Somewhere in the Mists~
The white mists surround you on all sides, stealing your sense of direction.
Strange forms appear and disappear at the edge of your vision. You whirl, but
they are gone before you can truly make out what they were. The ocean around
you is completely, eerily still. Tiny waves move toward what you think might
be the south, but it's difficult to say for sure in this directionless limbo.
A haunting melody draws you forward but is gone before you can trace it.
