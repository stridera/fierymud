Off the Shore~
   Directly behind you, enshrouded in misty whisps of blue-grey fog, lies the
familar sanctuary of the mainland.  The run-down streets, and tired buildings
of Specula seem safe and comforting in the face of the awesome ocean spread out
before you.  The panoramic views that enticed you from the beach are now more
than a little frightening - yet still beautiful.  The currents dictate your
passage here: South takes you out to sea, while North carries you back towards
safety and the shore.    ~

Far Off the Coast of Specula~
   A distant smoky mirage is all that can be seen of the now far-off shoreline
to your North.  Dominating your field of view is the enormous sea of fog and
water that seems infinite from your vantage point here among the waves.  To
your West are dangerous and impassable rocks, and nothing but salt-water lies
to your North, South and East.    ~

   A thin misty line to the North could possibly be land, but your eye is drawn
to other things: to the fiery sun above, to the crashing waves around you, and
to the countless variations of brilliantly coloured aquatic life swarming below
the surface of the clear green water.  A dangerous reef lies to your West and
open sea greets you in every other direction.    ~

only the reef wasn't directly in your path, perhaps you could make your way to
the jungle that spreads across the north face of the island.  As it is, you can
only return East to the great emptiness of the ever-present sea.    ~

   Great shards of rock jut violently from the sea to your South as the Great
Reefs continue in that direction.  Still further to the South is the Eastern
face of a fantastically beautiful island.  From here you can only see the steep
cliff-like rocks that are it's border, but you have heard many a tale of the
isle's natural beauty in both flora and fauna.  If the rocks did not mar your
path, perhaps you could witness these sights yourself.  As it is you can only
sail on to the North, West, and East, following the sun, or maybe a star in
your travels.    ~

Off the Coast of Fiery Island~
   Treacherously beautiful, brilliantly coloured coral reefs surround you to
the North and East.  Almost as if they were designed to, the reefs form a
protective barrier around the paradise-like isle that lies to your distant
East.  Beyond the coral, the island reaches beyond the grasp of the sea to
stretch towards the sky in the shape of a great, foreboding, volcanic mound.  
Despite the fiery nature of this tropical island, it is covered in luscious
greenery and its soft beaches and wild jungles are curiously inviting.  
Unfortunately, because of the sharp coral, the land is inaccessible from this
part of the ocean.  To your South and West the waves continue, inevitably,to
some far-off shore.    ~

your South rage and spit as they course around you.  Seagulls circle noisily
overhead and sea-breeze whips your hair into submission.  Nowhere in the great
Blue Fog Sea nor in all the lands it touches is the great power of the goddess

tedious miles of homogenous ocean roll on in every other direction.    ~

The Blue Fog Sea~
   Before you, and on all sides, extends a vast expanse of cool colours.  
Where your eyes blur and the horizon begins, the greys, the greens, and the
blues of the ocean blend into the sky.  Struck by the beauty and by the sheer
immensity of your surroundings, you feel unimportant, you feel insignificant,
and most of all, you feel so terribly vulnerable.  North, South, East, West, it
doesn't seem to matter much - the water is everywhere.    ~

Off the Coast of Fiery Island~
   Treacherously beautiful, brilliantly coloured coral reefs surround you to
the North and East.  Almost as if they were designed to, the reefs form a
protective barrier around the paradise-like isle that lies to your distant
East.  Beyond the coral, the island reaches beyond the grasp of the sea to
stretch towards the sky in the shape of a great, foreboding, volcanic mound.  
Despite the fiery nature of this tropical island, it is covered in luscious
greenery and its soft beaches and wild jungles are curiously inviting.  
Unfortunately, because of the sharp coral, the land is inaccessible from this
part of the ocean.  To your South and West the waves continue, inevitably, to
some far-off shore.    ~

Off the Cliffs of the Emerald Isle~
   A great wall of vertical rock slices its way to the sky from out of the
water that crashes fiercely against it to your West.  Glimmering high above
this natural cliff is the fabled "Shining City" of Odaishyozen.  You wish so
that you could explore its riches but from here you can only stare up the face
of these jagged rocks and dream.  Perhaps if the Great Reefs didn't extend this
far down South you could make your way onto the island to the North.  Alas,
this is not possible, but there is still a chance that the key to the
mysterious entrance to the isle is to be found to the South or to the East
where the seemingly infinite ocean rolls on and on...    ~

smashing waves of the ocean around you.  Perhaps this little lagoon is the way
in to the fabulous beauty of the fiery island that stretches beyond it to your

In Sight of the Lagoon~
   A short distance to your North there is a break in the barrier of coral reef
that has restricted your progress thus far - perhaps this is your chance to
gain access to the lagoon and the tropical beaches to your North.  Still the
water there is somehow darker than you've seen it elsewhere and as you recall
tales of sharks among the reefs you begin to question whether it's worth
venturing or not.  The safety and monotony of the open sea beckons to your West
and hidden rocks impede progress to your South and East.    ~

stand appears to be the only place where access to the lagoon, and through it
to the island, is possible.  The waters of the lagoon to your North are deathly
still when compared to the chaotic swirling of the tumultuous sea around you.
It's almost as if the water is paying tribute to the god of mayhem, but that
his realm extends not to the North, but to the South where the ocean stretches
its arms languidly towards infinity.    ~

Off the Cliffs of the Emerald Isle~
   A great wall of vertical rock slices its way to the sky from out of the
water that crashes fiercely against it to your West.  Glimmering high above
this natural cliff is the fabled "Shining City" of Odaishyozen.  You wish so
that you could explore its riches but from here you can only stare up the face
of these jagged rocks and dream.  Perhaps if the Great Reefs didn't extend this
far down South you could make your way onto the island to the North.  Alas,
this is not possible, but there is still a chance that the key to the
mysterious entrance to the isle is to be found to the South or to the East
where the seemingly infinite ocean rolls on and on...    ~

The Blue Fog Sea~
   Before you, and on all sides, extends a vast expanse of cool colours.  
Where your eyes blur and the horizon begins, the greys, the greens, and the
blues of the ocean blend into the sky.  Struck by the beauty and by the sheer
immensity of your surroundings, you feel unimportant, you feel insignificant,
and most of all, you feel so terribly vulnerable.  North, South, East, West, it
doesn't seem to matter much - the water is everywhere.    ~

here isn't hard to find.    ~

The Blue Fog Sea~
   Before you, and on all sides, extends a vast expanse of cool colours.  
Where your eyes blur and the horizon begins, the greys, the greens, and the
blues of the ocean blend into the sky.  Struck by the beauty and by the sheer
immensity of your surroundings, you feel unimportant, you feel insignificant,
and most of all, you feel so terribly vulnerable.  North, South, East, West, it
doesn't seem to matter much - the water is everywhere.    ~

North of the Southern Reefs~
   The ocean seems to pull you in an Easterly direction here, and the rapid and
dangerous currents prevent you from venturing any further South.  You find this
dismaying, as you can see a gorgeous sandy beach of fine white sand in the
not-too-far-off distance to your South.  On a comforting note, there are
rumored to be deadly flying creatures that infest that self-same beach so you
are probably safer where you are.  Though it would be difficult, you could
escape the currents to your North or follow them with abandon to your East.  ~

   The ocean seems to pull you in an Easterly direction here, towards a violent
rock outcrop that would spell catastrophe to any venturing in that direction by
sea.  The dangerously rapid currents here also prevent you from venturing any
further South.  You find this dismaying, as you can see a gorgeous sandy beach
of fine white sand and what appears to be a wrecked ship to the not too far off
South.  On a more comforting note, there are rumored to be deadly flying
creatures making their home on that self-same beach so you are probably safer
where you are.  Though it would be difficult, you could escape the currents to
your North.    ~

Beneath the Crumbling Arch~
   The cool breeze and cooler water extend, as ever, around you; what catches
your eye, however, is not the ocean beneath you, but the massive stone column
arching above your head.  It appears to have once stretched on further than you
can see to your North; but over time, it seems to have fallen victim to the
slow assault of wind and rain, and is now eroded and crumbling - a frail and
broken shadow of it's former mass and beauty.  Perhaps the many reefs and rocks
that seem to infest this sea were caused by the destruction of this once-great
bridge?  The overhead stone shadow continues to your South and fallen rocks to
your West make that way inaccessible.  As you have come to expect, the great
and inevitable sea stretches out further than your eyes can see to your East
and North.    ~

Where your eyes blur and the horizon begins, the greys, the greens, and the
blues of the ocean blend into the sky.  Struck by the beauty and by the sheer
immensity of your surroundings, you feel unimportant, you feel insignificant,
and most of all, you feel so terribly vulnerable.  North, South, East, West, it
doesn't seem to matter much - the water is everywhere.    ~

Below the Stone Arch~
   You stand in semi-darkness with a great stone arch over you blocking the
sun's fiery warmth and bright light.  The arch continues on over the sea to
your North and seems to have its beginnings on some rocky terrain to your
South.  Beyond it's base on either side there appears to be firm, dry land that
extends for some distance all around...  An island perhaps?  Certainly worth
exploring, anyway.  The sea stretches on to your North and giant rocks impede
any potential progress to your East and West.    ~

Entrance to a Narrow Inlet~
   A rocky outcrop to your West appears to be the beginning of a narrow inlet
that flows North towards a wider bay at it's base.  Further, beyond the bay,
lie sandy white beaches the likes of which your eyes have never beheld.  
Sparkling in the sun the beaches could be granulated diamond dust for all their
beauty.  The beaches appear to extend up towards firmer land that is covered in
lush greenery - truly this is a beautiful island.  Rocks bar your path to the
West, but this is of no consequence, as the beauty to the North calls you in
that direction, and that direction only.  Theoretically, it would be possible
to sail on to your South or East, but who would want to, in the face of such
paradise?    ~

there appears to be the rocky outcrop of an inlet's natural border.  This way

clear-watered bay.  The inlet itself seems to stretch on to meet soft sandy
beaches a ways to the North.  Possibly, this could be the famed semi-tropical
isle of Odaishyozen, of which you have heard so many wild tales.  At any rate,
it deserves a closer look.    ~

Where your eyes blur and the horizon begins, the greys, the greens, and the
blues of the ocean blend into the sky.  Struck by the beauty and by the sheer
immensity of your surroundings, you feel unimportant, you feel insignificant,
and most of all, you feel so terribly vulnerable.  North, South, East, West, it
doesn't seem to matter much - the water is everywhere.    ~
