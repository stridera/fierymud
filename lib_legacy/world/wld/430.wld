Beginning of Deimos Path~
   You stand at the beginning of Deimos Path, the sole manner of reaching the
mythical Demise Keep.  Dense lines of trees block your view of the path beyond
the bend, but in the distance you can make out the remains of the magical
fortress once known as The Towers of Votkno.  An unnatural sense of sadness
fills you as you compare the vibrant forests to the burnt structure.  You may
either journey along the path to the south or travel northward on the Obsidian
Path.

Deimos Path~
   You are walking along Deimos Path, the only manner of entry into Demise
Keep.  To either side of you, natural life strives to maintain the balance of
Nature; however, each glance towards the ruined structure of the keep dispels
this harmony for you.  You can't help but wonder at the evil which brought
about such destruction.  From this point, you can go either south towards the
keep, or north -- away from this sad place.

magical keep awaits your arrival, its burnt remains contrasting with the 
otherwise beautiful landscape. From this point,  you can either go to the 
south or to the north.

Deimos Path~
   You have reached a turn in Deimos Path.  Surveying the surrounding forest,
you sense -- more than see -- an evil slowly killing the land.  Perhaps it is
in the unnatural bends in the trees...or maybe the lack of any of the life
that was evident at the beginning of the path.  You can either continue towards
the Keep to the west or go to the north.

romantic carving in one of the trees which happens to have a boot sticking out
from the bark beside it.  From this point, you can either go to the east or the

   You find yourself at the final turn to reach Demise Keep. To the north, 
the colossal gates of the ruined fortress greet you with indifference. A 
strange distortion in the air ripples before the burnt metal, casting 
strangely humanoid shadows against the gateway. A sturdy drawbridge presents 
the only means of reaching the gateway. To either side of the span, there 
appears to be a deep pit. From this point, you can either go north or west.

skeletons of various unfortunate creatures -- your occasional human included. 
Looking to the north, the gateway appears even more massive than it had as 
viewed from the south. You can either go north to the gates or south to find 
a way out of this dismal place.

north transports the stale stench of death left over by whatever force brought
about this destruction.  You can enter the keep through the northern gate or
leave this place by travelling south.

this place is clearly illustrated by the various human limbs reaching
from the charred mass. You try not to stare at those faces frozen in
anguish as they were sealed into the very keep's structure. Perfectly
centered within this enclosure is a blue pentagram atop a slate of
black marble. The only apparent exit is to the south.

them within the stone, you know for certain that their deaths were not 
pleasant. A strip of the floor here glows with an ominous red tinge, a 
beacon which seems to brighten as you near it. From this point, you can

mirror~
You look into the mirror and fix your hair -- what a mess! Giving a
couple variations of your charming smile, you study the reflective
surface. Slowly, an image forms of a blue robed man and a giant red
entity situated before the remains of a magical frame. Although you can
not hear what is being said, you can discern that the man is quite
agitated and perhaps even a bit scared. The magical being, on the other
hand, flairs occasionally in what you interpret to be stages of rage.
It is clear that this poor human is on the losing end of this argument. 
Tendrils of energy slowly twine and merge into a giant whip-like form
over the magical being. Then the band of energy flicks the charged air 
and ... the image vanishes, only to reflect the confusion in your eyes.

carvings marble runes history~
The smooth, black marble walls of this chamber have several carvings on their
surface, apparently images outlining historical events.  Starting from the
center of the northern wall, the story unravels in a spiralling layout.  It
originates with what appears to be a group of sorcerers seating in a
semi-circle of thrones.  While thirteen sit attentive to an apparent leader,
another eleven appear to have their heads turned away.  The next scene depicts
the same groups, but now a symbol has been placed between them.  The dividing
rune looks spherical from its representation and appears to emit some form of
energy from which the sorcerers shield themselves.  The next image shows a
large, tentacled form with various magical script around it.  Smaller forms
cluster around the base of this dominant figure, lines streaking from their
forms indicating some sort of motion.  The next carving illustrates a magical
battle of epic proportions.  You can recognize the depictions of various spells
and techniques as the previously divided sorcerers unite to fight the new
threat.  The final image consists of an entire wall of ancient script with the
following words at the base:.    

                      Nogatotum Guardia Cyprianum

The Beginning of Ackbrin Run~
   Small, blue orbs float here, illuminating the way.  You find yourself at the
beginning of a long corridor known as Ackbrin Run.  Rumor has it that it was
this very passage that Seblan the Young fled down once he realized that the
fortress was lost.  It is said that at intervals along the passageway, you can
find the product of each of his tears, having been influenced by the wild
magical forces which led to the destruction of the towers above.  The rumors
also claim that the tortured soul of Seblan, held prisoner by the magic of this
evil place, still haunts the lower levels of the keep.  Echoes of the mage's
weeping seem to support this.  From this point, you can either travel along the
passageway to the west or go through a door set in the northern wall.

   You find yourself in a passageway carved from red marble. Small,
blue orbs follow your progress, illuminating the walkway. Echoes of
a maudlin soul seem to be coming from further down the corridor.
The passageway continues to the east and the west.

   Small, blue orbs follow your progress, illuminating the walkway.
You have reached another turn in Ackbrin Run. The sobbing continues 
somewhere further into the keep; yet, it seems to be getting louder. 
From this point, you can either go west or north.

Seblan's Chamber~
   You are standing within a giant chamber made of black marble.  Immediately
in front of you is a massive semi-circle of thrones.  A deathly silence has
fallen over the chamber and you sense a power building.  Looking about, you
note a shimmering portal to the north and a darker portal to the south; both
magical in nature.  From this point, you can enter either of the portals to the
north or south, or go eastward.

Seblan's Chamber~
   You are standing within a giant chamber made of black marble, but which is
lined with the same unidentifiable material as the corridor a ways to the east.
Words composed of a dark fire scroll against the wall to the south while words
apparently made of smoke scroll against the wall to the north.  Nearby to the
west, a massive semi-circle of thrones can be seen.  Through the poor
illumination of this chamber, you think you see a figure slouched in the
central throne.  From this point, you can either go east or west.

dark fire~
The words composed of the dark fire read:
      Though set in cause were Seblan and his order,
      Our task, as opposed, came to bear anew.
      Racing to the Tower of Voliangloch,
      Our plot of disruptive Magic slowly grew.
      As the Gateway churned, screaming for release,
      The Great Voliangloch did unify our hate.
      Giant bolt made of maliciously azure fire,
      Would be the end of Seblan and this debate.

smoke~
The words composed of smoke read:
      Brooding on the boundaries of Mayhem
      My thoughts made dull through the eons
      A spark of Magic did awaken my sense
      Ah, these ignorant, little peons!
      My form in flight towards the light,
      My goal the freedom of yesterday...
      I breached the barrier upon pinpoint made,
      Smashing all wards keeping me from play.
      Summoning my children through the rift,
      A tendril's worth of reality in my grip...
      I restored my order of timeless reign,
      And from the zealous mortals, life did slip.

   You are standing within a giant chamber made of black marble, but which is

apparently made of ice scroll against the wall to the south.  Further to the
west, a semi-circle of marble thrones can be seen.  Blinking, you could almost
swear that you see someone sitting in the central throne.  From this point, you
can either go east or west.

      To other planes called Seblan the Young.
      Stirrings of power, then the Great Crash...
      Thrown into disorder, the order was crushed,
      The Gateway shattered, screaming Demise.
      Cyprianum, a product of Magic trusted;
      Yet, twisted into another plane...
      As dark minions overcame the powerful defenses
      Our order's souls were easily slain.

fire~
The words made of fire read:
      With time laid bare in that crucial moment,
      The neutral robes retreated to S'ien Tower.
      Gateway composed and strength combined
      With force magnified by each present power,
      The spell began of noble intent,
      Though its result we have come to resent;
      Yet, of the darkness, all were prepared,
      Their might too was also shared.
      The clash of the forces, a massive War,
      Wards of the Gateway, smashing the core...
      The magic did leap and do its Master's bidding;
      Yet, no one now knew which Master was fitting.
      From the darkness of fire emerged a darker being,
      Cyprianum, the Entity of Reaping.

Entrance to Seblan's Chamber~
   You find yourself in a large chamber made of black marble, but which is
lined with the strange material of the corridor to the east.  A heavy mist
awaits you on the eastward side of the portal, obviously held back by some form
of Magic.  To the west, the chamber continues, faintly illuminated by small,
blue orbs which follow your progress as you journey.  At the far end of the
chamber, you make out a large semi-circle of nine thrones, apparently made of
differentially colored marble.  There is a haze around this area which
restricts a better view.  From this point, you can either go through the portal
to the east or go further into Seblan's Chamber to the west.

lightning arc from a portal set into the western wall, strangely lacking any
manner of report.  The subtle buzz of heated conversation seems strongest at

reached the end of Ackbrin Run.  Suddenly, the rather annoying sobs terminate
and you are left in silence broken by an occasional dripping noise.  To the
north, a massive, blood-red door dominates the wall.  On its surface glow
spidery words of magic.  You note that you can either venture through a door to
the north or travel down the passageway to the west.

door spidery words magic~
The spidery words unravel to transport their message:
      Cast for the subversion of strife,
      The spell let its spiral fly free.
      Amidst the chaos of runes bright...
      Evil minions cackled with glee.
      No more the master, now the slave,
      Young Seblan fell into said state.
      No longer a fool, yet not improved,
      Maudlin soul forever behind this gate.

High Above Deimos Path~
   From this vantage point, you can see the extent of damage inflicted on the
once mighty Demise Keep.  The most apparent observation is the centralization
of the blast which destroyed much of the keep.  The entire northwestern section
of this territory has been entirely leveled, only the blackened remains of the
great explosion visible.  Skeletal trees line that perimeter, silent mourners
of the souls lost.

High Above Deimos Path~
   You can almost touch the remains of the last standing tower of Demise Keep
as you sail past it.  The surrounding forest looks even more ominous from this
angle, as it would appear that all of their limbs are pointing towards you.
