Shoreline~
   A pure white beach skirts the blue waters of an ocean.  An ornamental red
gate sticks up out of the water near the sand.  To the north, the island itself
is shrouded in mists, but a green mountain can be seen stretching toward the
sky.  A pebbled path begins here and heads north, toward a golden wall.    ~

Something huge and dazzling rises before you to the north, with hills behind
it, rising like giant emeralds.  The grey volcano rises even higher, embracing
the city and its green fields and hills -- an excellent natural defense against
invaders.  This inlet and path seem to be the only way into the city.  A carved
stone lantern stands here.~

The Yomeimon Gate~
   The locals, some people might discover, call this place 'The Live-Long-Day
Gate' for how long one might stand and stare at its splendor.  It's two stories
tall, made of wood that's been gilded in beaten gold, and is just covered in
carvings of dragons, lions, phoenixes, and ogres, as well as scenes from nature
like steep, jagged cliffs and oceans.  A gilded pine tree dominates the gate's
center.  Around the gate, huge walls stretch to the east and west, protectively
encircling the city that lies beyond it.  The green hills past here tend to be
mist-embraced, their color contrasting with the gold of the gate and the grey
stone of the walls.~

   The sturdy gate is made of thick wood covered in pure gold, and is carved
with fantastic beasts and nature scenes.  When it's open, fertile fields and
shining roads can be seen, and past that, emerald hills covered in mist.
An inscription is set on a golden plaque at the side of the gate, written
in a strange script.~

You can't imagine why a guard tower has pictures on its walls. Perhaps

The Upper Gate~
   The upper part of the gate is just as dazzling as the one below.  It's a
stone platform with a red tile roof, and some narrow holes in it for archers to
use.  Sunlight streams in past the archer's windows.  It has no walls; instead,
it opens up directly into the wall, which stretches far to the east and west.
From here, the entire city spreads out to the north, with its huge fields,
green and multi-rowed, and its labyrinth of interconnected buildings. Two
magnificent buildings dominate the view--palaces, perhaps.~

Rice Fields~
   The tall green rice plants don't quite hide the water flooding the field.  
In places the sun reflects off the water, glinting like diamonds among the lush
green of the rice plants.  Here and there birds wheel across the sky, dipping
low to catch insects from the water.  The people working in the fields glower
at you, clearly wanting you to get out of their fields before you destroy the
delicate plants.  You have reached the edge of the rice fields.  Beyond this,
you see barren, impassable ground, ending at the mountain itself, which rises
all around the city.    ~

The Revolving Stage~
   Wooden steps, sturdy but plain, descend from a gigantic disk-shaped
cutout in the stage floor above. Below it a crosspost extends from the 
center of the disk to the packed-earth floor, showing signs of wear 
along its base that indicate it's been rotated often. The disk itself
has eight smaller posts going down from the circle to within three feet
of the ground. The underground passage extends southward, but the
only exit lies upstairs.~

with an intricate cross-branch design seems designed to allow someone inside to
see outside without anyone being able to see his or her identity. Some of the
"branches" of the blind are pushed open wider with bits of paper for better

that "Empty space is imperishable.  " And it shows here.  A fire-pit is in the
middle of the room, surrounded by thin cushions.  The sunlight spills into the
room from the skylights above.  A rack hangs on one wall.  You can go into the

organization. Every single element has its own special place on the
wooden counters and along the room's whitewashed walls. A cooking pit
is set in one corner, oval stones ringing its small circumference. A
low rack near the pit is hung with pots. Utensils hang neatly from 
pegs and hooks right below the pots. A pair of gauze towels are folded
neatly on the countertop beside the cooking pit.~

a seemingly dead tree set into the middle of a well-tended shrine made of
pretty pink stone.  Long bits of paper are folded into narrow strips and tied
around the tree's branches.  You take one of the bits of paper and unroll it.
You can't read the writing, but you can see the tearstains on it.  Perhaps it's
a prayer of some sort.  That would make sense.  Looking around, you see the

windows and through a skylight propped open with a carved staff of bamboo.

floor.  You can elect to head north, back to the walkway, or south, into the

over perfectly manicured grasses.  The pathstones are laid down with almost
random order, yet you tread them easily, barely even noticing them.  Here and

and railings, though it also has no carving or ornamentation.  An entrance just

The Peasant Courtyard~
   The courtyard of Shimabara is the entrance to a floating world, populated by
those brave souls who can live for the moment, and ignore the outer world and
its strict structure, its harsh insistence on honor and responsibility.
Graceful bonsai trees, small and twisting, grow in wooden pots all around the
periphery of the elegant courtyard, bending gracefully over colored grasses
and wildflowers. The tightly-fitted hexagonal stones of the ground are
scrupulously clean and shiny. Quiet conversation in exotic tones wafts through
the air from the various visitors here, mingling with a scent of wildflowers
and perfume. A bar is visible to the north, and the street runs to the south.~

gracefully bow and weave with trays of small ceramic cups and tangy
seafood plates among loud, gesturing guests. The strains of a foreign
instrument rise through the voices to linger on the air, though the
music sounds more like silverware being dropped. Some of the more
inebriated guests are howling a bawdy tune to it. Kitchens lie to the

A Brightly-Lit Katte~

kitchen. During the day, sunshine spills in through a skylight. At night,
lamps keep everything lit with bright golden light. The kitchen itself is
very well-organized, with pots stacked neatly in shelves against one wall
near a huge pit that blazes with a cooking-fire. Teapots hang from hooks
above it. A vast iron cauldron simmers on the fire at all times, with
unfamiliar scents rising from it--fish, vegetables, and an odd tang.

floors, or the gracefully arched roof above, with its skylights to let in
gentle sunshine.  A double row of wooden pillars marks off a center strip of
the room that is clearly a performing area, with polished wooden floors and
lots of room to move.  The rows on either side of this center strip are
tatami-lined, obviously intended to be sat upon by guests watching someone
perform in the middle section. The area is very subdued-looking, certainly
not bawdy or risque. Paper-lined windows let in muted light to the south,
and exits lead north to an audience section or east to a hallway.~

closet with doorknobs carved with dragonflies and herons, and, tucked into one

imagine, all swimming around like they know and don't care that they're going
to be someone's dinner very soon.  A fishmonger cuts fish into sashimi for

for Odaishyozen soups, unfamiliar salty-sharp scents that tantalize and tempt.
All manner of men are here, some wearing the double swords that mark the noble
warriors who live here, followed by servants carrying paper-wrapped parcels.

Everything here is simple but of high quality, with little thought given
to security or potential theft. The main counter, indeed, is out of

pikes, and shortswords. Most of them are gracious and simple in design,

entering the garden. In the middle of it, a fountain fed by a bamboo tube
babbles in the semi-light filtering in through the trees from the brightly-

You marvel at the magnificent talent and skills of whoever painted 
these murals. In sparse, unsparing brushstrokes, the story is told.
Humans and gods and fantastic beasts are almost a side interest beside
fabulous vistas and incredible backdrops of mountains, oceans, storms, and
howling winds. The Sea Serpent figures in rather prominently, its bulky
form blotting out the sun as it towers above the comparably puny walled
city of Odaishyozen. The glowing figure of a beautiful woman stands before
it, arms outstretched as if to stop it single-handedly. She stands on the
wall of the city, her black hair streaming out behind her, her robes
plastered to her body in the storm.~

The Shoin (Receiving Room)~
   The receiving room is spacious, with cushions on the floor that invite you
to sink to your weary knees.  The pictures on the wall are of flowers and
animals -- hardly what you expected from the house of warriors.  But you can't
help but notice how the walls are scarred, as if from sword-cuts.  You think to
yourself that perhaps these warriors aren't so weak after all.  You can go

   The art room!  You enter, and your soul sings.  Sculpture in recessed
alcoves beckons you to come and lose yourself in contemplation.  Softly lit
pictures of history, of the natural world's splendor, of people past and
present, line the walls.  Somewhere you hear music, soft and lulling.  The
treasures in this room alone make you wonder about Odaishyozen.  What kind of
people put their most beautiful treasures out for public display like this?  
Nothing is even guarded.  They must be powerful indeed, these warriors, to be
so confident in their name that they don't guard their wealth.    ~

   You don't know what you expected of the sleeping quarters of the Emperor,

is huge and nearly empty except for the bed and a sitting area in one corner,
lined with cushions and mats.  A small table set low to the ground occupies
another corner.  On the table you see incense burning.  The Emperor must be

Several varieties of exquisitely-pruned trees, most of them smaller than
the norm for their respective species, line the pond, while a single rock
rises up from just slightly off-center in the water itself to make an
elegant argument for asymmetry. Colorful silk cushions in sunset-orange,
black, and midnight blue are arranged just so on the platform.

climax of the entire island.  Maybe it is.  This part of the chamber is raised
still a little more from the middle step.  A dais at the far end of the room is
raised still more, and a gold-embroidered cushion set in its center makes it

the cares of this world, and to contemplate his evil plans upon Odaishyozen.  
As such, you see many, many books upon his shelves, with titles that make your
skin crawl from horror.  Yajiro has been busy, all right.  A grimoire stands
open on a stand in one corner, illuminated by a lamp whose cover is made of
skin of some kind.  You glance at it, and are horrified to realize that it is a
spell for capturing a deity.  A mirror winks in one corner.  Other than going

   A craggy outcropping of rock, barely wide enough to walk upon, forms a
protective arm around a light blue channel of water that extends from north to
south, toward a distant island that is at least partially obscured from vast
amounts of ocean spray rising from what must be an extraordinarily large
whirlpool.    ~

The Channel~
   A channel of azure blue water ends here, just before a massive whirlpool to
the north.  The flotsam and jetsam of many boats litters the water.  The noise
of the whirlpool to the north is deafening, and the spray limits visibility.  ~

The Whirlpool~
   Rushing, roaring, deafening water forms a massive whirlpool that would
terrify even the most hardened sailor.  Swirling waters form a white-capped
surf, and nothing at all is visible around or beyond the blinding spray.  It
might be possible to swing out of the whirlpool to the north.    ~

An Inlet~
   The roar of water to the south deafens, but here, the noise seems almost
hollow.  This inlet is fairly calm, and thickly humid with cool waterspray.  
The water laps gently at a white-pebbled shoreline.  To the north, an emerald
green island rises out of the deep azure waters, and a shining gate is visible
not too far to the north.    ~
