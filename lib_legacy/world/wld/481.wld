Mouth of the Lagoon~
   You have entered a body of water which is sheltered from the salty sea by a
ridge of coral.  The lagoon is very calm and as you peer into the water, you
are surprised to discover that you can see the sandy bottom.  A multitude of
gaily colored fish swim underneath you, blissfully unaware of your presence.  
Suddenly hungry, you plunge your hand into the warm water in an attempt to
snare a particularly fat fish which easily evades your clumsy grab.  
Disappointed, you raise your eyes to the island looming before you, and in
particular to the volcano which dominates and birthed this island.  The sight
of the volcano fills you with awe...  And fear.  Although its green slopes
attest to its dormancy, it possesses an abeyant energy which hints at explosive
power.  To the west and east the island juts out to the sea in two points thick
with jungle trees.  You don't think you could force your way through the tangle
of trees, even if you wanted to.  To the south, you see the great expanse of
the ocean.  The lagoon continues to the north.    ~

the wonderful variety of life this lagoon harbors.  To the west an impassable
tangle of jungle trees crowds closely to the shore, but the lagoon continues to

The Sandy Beach~
   You step onto the rough sand of this beach and stare for some time at the
peaceful lagoon.  Despite the heat and humidity of this island, you feel this
would be a very pleasant place to live.  The smell of the jungle is strong here
and you absorb the exotic aromas as you rest.  To the east you spot a faint
track leading into the jungle depths.  The track could be an animal trail...  
Or it could be man-made.  Passage to the west and north is blocked by a thick
growth of jungle trees.  The lagoon stretches before you to the south.    ~

   The trail winds madly through the jungle, at times going north, then east,
then south.  After a time, however, it straightens out and runs in a generally
east-west direction.  At one point it curves suddenly to the north; you may
either continue along the trail to the north, or follow the trail west, back to
the sandy beach.  The way to the east and south is blocked by a thick tangle of
jungle trees.    ~

The Jungle Trail~
   As you walk along the trail a peculiar rock lying along the way draws your
attention.  Curious, you pick the stone up and find that it is not a plain
rock, but a piece of obsidian that has been fashioned into a spearhead.  
Disturbed, you turn the spearhead nervously in your hand as you scan the jungle
for signs of danger.  You become determined to be more wary of this strange new
land.  You let the obsidian drop from your hand, allowing it to serve as a
warning to future visitors that this island harbors humanoids who are no
strangers to violence, and who may be hostile.  The trail continues to the west
and east.  Passage to the north and south is blocked by a thick tangle of
jungle trees.    ~

jungle birds.  You fail to identify the sound at first, but you gradually
recognize the faint cadence of a humanoid tongue.  The jungle seems to play
tricks with noises, for you cannot identify the direction from which the sound
issues.  The trail splits at this point; you may follow it either to the north,
west, or east.  Passage to the south is blocked by a thick tangle of jungle
trees.    ~

The Jungle Tribe Village~
   You have entered a clearing that is ringed on three sides by well-maintained
huts.  In the center of the clearing is a large fire pit lined with basalt
rocks.  Around the pit several logs are arranged in a roughly spherical
pattern; you can easily imagine a group of tribes folk sitting on these logs,
eating dinner.  You wonder what it is they eat, and hope they do not count
human flesh among their delicacies.  You may enter either of the three huts, or
return to the jungle trail, which is to the west.~

the chief holds that the others lack is the luxury of privacy, for his quarters
are barren.  You wonder why villagers living on an island as seemingly rich as
this one would be so poor in material goods.  The exit is to the north.    ~

Beginning of the Ash Tunnel~
   You have entered a tunnel which runs to the north and south.  A foul odor
wafts from the chimera's cave to the south; shuddering with the memory of that
fearsome beast, you realize that the chimera may not be the most loathsome
monster you will have to fight today.  The floor of this tunnel is covered with
a fine layer of soot.  The layer of soot appears to be thickest to the north.~

The Ash Tunnel~
   Studying the walls of this tunnel, you realize this passageway was made by
no natural force; these tunnels were hewn out of rock, fashioned by stonewise
and intelligent beings.  The ash is thicker here than to the south and becomes
noticeably denser to the east.  You may continue along the tunnel by following
it as it curves to the east, or head south back toward the chimera's cave.    ~

   Studying the walls of this tunnel, you realize that this passageway was not
made by a natural force; these tunnels were hewn out of rock, fashioned by
stonewise and intelligent beings.  The floor of this tunnel is covered with a
thick ash; the ash is thickest along the sides of the tunnel, rising up above
your kneecaps.  A furrow in the ash runs through the center of the tunnel.  
This furrow was created by the passage of many creatures; the small, delicate
footprints of these humanoids are clearly visible in the ash.  As you stand
ankle-deep in the center of the ash passageway, you see you may follow the
tunnel to either the west or east.    ~

As you make your way to the center of this cavernous room, you choke on the ash
which is disturbed by your passing and rises, mist-like, into the air.

The Worker's Den~
   You have discovered the sleeping quarters of the pitiful creatures which are
forced to burrow tunnels through the mighty volcano.  The room is cramped, and
lacks furnishings or decorations of any kind.  In view of the fact that the
Mountain Tribe are slaves, and poorly treated at that, you find it curious that
there are no guards to oversee their work, no guards to insure they do not run
away or rebel.  You find yourself wondering what prevents the dwarrow from
leaving.  Perhaps there is more here than meets the eye.  There is a vent of
warm air on the east wall large enough to enter.  The air coming from the vent
is very warm.  You may enter the heat vent to the east, or return to the ash
tunnel west.~

The Family Den~
   This small room is packed with a miserable lot of the Mountain Tribe
dwarves.  Their large eyes stare at you pitifully as you enter the chamber.  
You note that although they are disturbed by your presence, they don't seem
particularly afraid of you.  Perhaps they have lived under a cloud of fear and
oppression for so long they have lost sensitivity to these emotions.  The
expression on their faces is one of resignation, and you know that were you to
draw your weapon and slay one of these dwarrows, she would take no action to
defend herself.  You notice suddenly that the dwarrows in this chamber are
either all female or are all children; perhaps this is how the tribe's loyalty
is gained: by separating the men from the women, and holding the women as
hostages for the men's good behavior.  The only visible exit is to the north,
and leads back to the ash tunnel.~

volcano.  The floor of the tunnel is uneven, at times seeming to slope upward,
at other times sloping down.  The walls of this tunnel are pitted and appear to
have been blackened with fire.  The tunnel continues to the west, east, and
south.  To the east you perceive a great, heavy darkness which seems to swallow
up your light.  Suddenly feeling small and defenseless, you take an involuntary
step towards the west, away from the mysterious darkness.    ~

At the Edge of the Darkness~
   As you approach the source of the darkness you see a great, gaping maw that
seems to lead straight down to the very center of the earth.  You take a
fragmented rock and toss it into the maw, listening closely for the sound of an
impact, counting silently to judge the distance.  You stand at the lip of the
pit for several minutes, but fail to hear an impact.  Shaking your head in
wonder, you begin to turn from the edge when suddenly the rock beneath your
feet crumbles!    ~

Along the Inner Rim of the Volcano~
   The tunnel before you opens up to reveal a cylinder in the center of the
volcano.  This cylinder is so wide you cannot see the far side of it, so deep
you cannot see the bottom.  A stone walkway begins at the end of the smooth
tunnel and, slanting downward, winds along the inner rim of this cylinder.  
Stepping onto this walkway and peering into the depths, your light just barely
illuminates the same stone walkway several dozen meters directly below you,
continuing along in its downward spiral.  The walkway extends along the rim of
the volcano to the east, gently curving to the north as it does so.  To the
south you see the smooth tunnels.    ~

railing of this walkway.  After a time you regain your emotional balance and
begin your slow spiral along the walkway.  The walkway extends along the rim of
the volcano to the north and south.  To the north, you see that the walkway
curves to the west and brings you to a point which is opposite the beginning of
this walkway.  To the south, the walkway also curves to the west, and will lead
you to the beginning of the walkway.    ~

   The stone walkway connects the tower to the rim of the volcano.  The walkway
is rather narrow and you must proceed single-file along its length.  Unlike the
walkway which spirals along the rim, there is no railing here and sweat dampens
your forehead as you realize how easy it would be to fall into the darkness.  
As you close the distance to the tower you realize that the tower is composed
of pure ivory.  The walkway ends at a gate to the west and continues to the
south, where it melds with the stones of the volcano and begins its upward
spiral.    ~

interest in your battle-scarred visage, turn away in disgust and examine the
room.  The mirrors themselves line the walls, the ceiling and even the floor,
causing you to step carefully to avoid damaging the fragile looking-glasses.  
Mirrors also stand freely, and seemingly without support, at random locations
in the room.  Of particular interest are oval glasses that decorate the west,
north, and south walls, as well as the floor.  The reflection these mirrors
cast is filmy and distorted.  Exits from the room are through a gate to the
east or up a stairwell that is set in the center of the room.    ~

There are several mirrors which are set apart from the others, however,
due to their unusually large size and the odd, filmy reflection they cast.
As you peer into one of these unique mirrors you catch of faint glimpse
of some outwordly scene the flickers across the surface of the mirror like
ripples across water.
  You also notice that each of the filmy mirrors have an unusually thick
frame with a latch on one end and hinges on the others. The frame contains
a glass covering which protects the mirror from direct contact with your
skin. Now, why would anyone want to put a glass case over a mirror?~

Surrounded by Darkness~
   Here you are, surrounded by darkness, with nothing between you and the
center of the earth but air.  You feel sorry for yourself and begin to review
your life.  It is not a long life but you have plenty of time so you spend much
time contemplating it.  Resigned at your fate, you lace your hands behind your
head, and, elbows sticking out like awkward wings, try to make yourself as
comfortable as possible.    ~

Deep Beneath the Earth~
   Shakily, you examine your surroundings.  The bottom of this pit is very
warm; the rock is rough and sharp.  Looking above you, you see nothing but the
pit leading up far beyond the reach of your light.  The weight of the earth and
the weight of the darkness seem to press down on you.  You feel very small and
insignificant, you worm you.    ~

A Glowing Tunnel~
   The air here is uncomfortably warm.  The tunnel glows with a white-orange
light coming in from the north.  Unlike the ash tunnel, this tunnel is of
naturally formed obsidian, and has very little ash or debree in it.  To the
west is a small cavern, cramped with sleeping quarters.  To the north is the
source of the heat and light you experience here.~

At The Burning Wall~
   The obsidian tunnel narrows dramatically here.  The walls are radiant with a
hot white-orange glow.  Immediatly north of you, you come to a dead end of
sorts.  The tunnel continues north, but a steady drizzle of lava and fire forms
an impassable wall.  You are forced to turn back south.~

Near A Side Vent~
   The open sea air is surprisingly refreshing.  A side vent to the south leads
into the volcano.  A small path runs along the volcano face.  The sea stretches
out endlessly to the north.  If you are careful to avoid the drizzling lava,
you could go south into the volcano.  The only other exit is west on the face.~

North Face of the Volcano~
   You find yourself on the north face of the volcano, its peak rising above
you on the south, and in every other direction, the ocean.  The ground on which
you stand is on an extreme slant, and very loose beneath your feet.  All you
can discern from this vantage is the basalt landslide in which you find
yourself.  You can work your way east or west along the volcano.~

A Basalt Ledge~
   The otherwise loose rock forms a solid shelf here.  From this ledge you can
sea seemingless endless ocean.  The water get turbulent as it nears the rocky
shores of Fiery Island.  The volcano fumes behind you from minor vents.  
Though the ocean breaze keeps the air comfortable, yuo can feel the heat
radiating up from the ground.~

Basalt Shelf~
   Solid rock walls surround you on 3 sides, with the north opening up to a
ledge above the sea.  The wind is still here, blocked by the volcanos rock
walls.  Scorch marks mar the area, as if some mage battles had taken place here
recently.~
