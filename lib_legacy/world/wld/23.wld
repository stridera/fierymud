Path Near a Fortified Borderhold~
   The stout walls of a borderhold stand just to the north, their stony gray
surfaces scarred with deep knicks and minor damage.  A fortified military
outpost on the border along the Wailing Mountains and the northern caravan
route, Toldar Keep stands in rigid defiance of marauding orc hordes.  A wide
swath of open grassland has been cleared between the hold and the plains to the
south, giving the keep's lookouts enough warning against southern incursions.
A dirt road presents open access to the borderhold's gates to the north and
winds into the plains.~

Before the Borderhold's Southern Gates~
   Two huge iron gates swing inward on similarly massive hinges, barring and
granting access to the military encampment within.  Each gate is heavily
reinforced by wide steel braces, promising sturdy protection against battering
rams.  The borderhold's high walls run outward from the gates, facing the
plains to the south.    ~

   A large stone wall runs along to the south, its gray stone knicked and
pitted from the elements and bands of mauraders about the borderlands.  
Interrupting the wall's continuous length, a tall iron gate swings inwards on
strong reinforced steel hinges.  A well-traveled dirt path runs through the
gate into the plains beyond, also continuing north into town.  Following the
wall around the military encampment, another dusty path runs to the east and
west from here.    ~

through the keep easily.  A large rectangular building hulks just off the road
to the east, its flat beige wall looking quite uninteresting.  Jolly laughter
echoes out of a small tavern to the west.  A large gate is just to the south.~

heights affording a degree of protection to the permanent military encampment.
A pair of large reinforced iron gates further the keep's protection, each
standing approximately fifteen feet high and lined with several bands of heavy
steel.  The sturdy gray stone walls surrounding the borderhold are equally
secure, stretching to either side of the gates.  Lookouts mounted atop the
walls provide a clear view of the mountain pass to the north.  Although little
more than a fortified outpost, it would take quite a force to conquer this
town.    ~

made and neat, stray armor and clothing hung up cleanly in the closets lining
the walls.  A metal basin sits at the end of each set of bunks, providing
soldiers a place to maintain their hygiene.  The rows of bunks continue to the
west, and a large wooden door sits in the north wall.    ~

A Well-Stocked Armory~
   The borderhold is apparently quite well supplied by its mother state of
Solta!  This armory holds hundreds of articles of war, ranging from iron
longswords and strudy long bows to shirts of chainmail and visored steel
helmets.  A long row of lances is attached to the north wall, hanging over a
collection of odd-shaped pieces of armor.    ~

The Campaign Room~
   Built from sturdy Rhell wood, a large oval table occupies the majority of
this room.  Various maps and documents lie scattered across the surface of the
table, showing images and details of the surrounding area.  A ring of soft,
comfortable-looking chairs encircles the table.  On the west end of the room, a
large black board hangs on the wall, myriad chalk diagrams scratched upon its
face.    ~

The chalk diagrams on the black board consist of several complicated diagrams.
At the center of the board, a large circle with the words "Toldar Keep" has
been drawn, with several arrows pointing outwards at squares.  A procession of
triangles runs just above the large circle, and a thin line stretches out from
either side of it.    ~

A Sheltered Stable~
   A simple slanted roof, held up by two sturdy wooden beams, provides shelter
from rain and other adverse weather conditions for this roomy stable.  Several
bales of hay lie stacked along its edges, adding a bit of warmth and bedding
for mounts stabled here.  A clean-looking water trough provides fresh drink,
while a large supply of bags of oats rest by the south wall, ready to be fed to
horses.  To the south, a small wooden door leads into the Tavern of the Fallen
Star, while to the north and east a short wooden fence offers the only barrier
between the stable and the passing dirt roads.    ~

Vale of Anlun~
   Thick foilage leaps up from the fertile earth of this lush valley, creating
a dark green blanket of life over the whole area.  Plants spanning a thousand
different species flourish here, cared for by the mystical powers of the druids
and their goddess.  Huge oaks spring up in every corner, throwing out their
huge canopies of healthy leaves to blanket the sky.  Just off to the east,
several strange monoliths are detectable through the plantlife.    ~

An Arched Gateway Entwined With Roses~
&0   The curved remains of an ancient stone arch guard the entrance to
a sort of clearing to the east. The arch is constructed of dark stone,
carved into large square blocks. Wild roses, the color of deep crimson,
wind their away up each side of the arch. Their fresh blossoms open
outwards, letting loose with a perfume like fragrance. Below the thick
cords of thorned vines, runes are visible, etched into the stone
centuries ago.~

Heart of the Vale~
   Home to the council of druids, the vale's heart has been designed by nature
and her guardians.  Proud oaks dot the clearing, providing shelter with their
massive canopies of leaves.  Around the oaks, lush grass and exotic flowering
plants are visible.  Foilage fills in most of the remaining space, creating a
natural barrier around the area.  A stone column is visisble in each of the
clearing's four corners, each column standing over ten feet tall.  These
monoliths stand defiantly against time itself, their weathered appearance
several centuries old.    ~

lame and wagon wheels snap.  For this reason, the path is seldom used.    ~

Rocky Path in the Wailing Mountains~
   Cutting along the mountain range's edge, this path winds itself along the
jagged rock.  Large stones and hundreds of pebbles lie strewn about, left from
past avalanches.  The air is bitter cold, burning at exposed flesh with its icy
touch.  Huge mounds of snow and ice line the path, creating dangerous patches
that can easily spell death for the unwary.  The path itself slopes in a
gradual upward direction, but turns and twists in several directions along the
way.    ~

Rocky Path in the Wailing Mountains~
   Cutting along the mountain range's edge, this path winds itself along the
jagged rock.  Large stones and hundreds of pebbles lie strewn about, left from
past avalanches.  The air is bitter cold, burning at exposed flesh with its icy
touch.  Huge mounds of snow and ice line the path, creating dangerous patches
that can easily spell death for the unwary.  The path itself slopes in a
gradual upward direction, but turns and twists in several directions along the
way.    ~

A Gigantic Roc Nest~
   A huge mound of dried trees and foilage has been dragged up to this lonely
section of the mountain path, creating a massive circular nest.  The nest is
woven together firmly, allowing it to resist even the strongest of mountain
storms.  A fine layer of soft fluff has been threaded throughout the upper
layer of the nest, allowing the young to remain warm and comfortable while they
grow.  Scattered bones of horses and humanoids lie strewn about, past meals for
the babies and their parents.    ~

Before an Ancient Cave~
   A small opening, perhaps six feet across, leads northward into the face of a
rocky wall.  At first glance, it appears to be a natural structure.  Piled snow
covers part of it, with a stunted mountain shrub sticking up from beneath the
white mound.  Faint etchings line the cave's mouth however, drawn with such
precision that they could not possibly be some fluke of nature.  It seems to be
some sort of writing, but with origins that go beyond any known race.  The path
contiues away from the cave to the east and west, winding back down the rocky
mountainside.  It would also be possible to climb up over the cave mouth.    ~

Inside a Sprawling Cavern~
   The cave opening leads into a natural cavern, its walls having been formed
by erosion or perhaps an ancient earthquake.  The walls are rough, cracked with
jagged protrusions jutting out at odd intervals.  As it leads farther back into
the mountain, the cavern opens up even wider.  At the widest it is about two
hundred feet across, with a vaulted ceiling about half that distance from the
floor.  A chilling breeze blows in from the outside, gushing through the cavern
and blowing back out through numerous tiny cracks that run along the walls and
ceiling.  A long tunnel leads northward, deeper into the rocky surroundings.  
The Wailing Mountains are to the south.    ~

A Rectangular Chamber~
   The rough walls of the cavern outside quickly disappear, replaced with the
carefully carved outlines of smooth bricks.  The area here is rectangular in
shape, stretching about a hundred feet long and perhaps fifty feet across.  It
appears to be some sort of antechamber.  Ancient metallic fixtures shaped like
grasping claws are positioned at even intervals about the room, offering a
steady glow when each holds a torch.  The rest of the chamber is bare, save for
the floor's center.  Carved upon the flat stone floor is a intricate mosaic
depicting a vicious demonic figure facing off against a winged female.  In the
very center floats an aquamarine stone that they seem to be fighting over.  In
the background a terrible war between good and evil is taking place, with both
sides losing heavily.  The rest of the room is oddly bare, without even the
dust that would be expected in such an ancient place.    ~

A Hidden Altar Room~
   A set of worn stone stairs leads from the antechamber above, spiraling down
about ten feet to the inner chamber.  This room is crafted of carved bricks
similiar to the ones above, each chiseled without a flaw.  Most are bare gray
stone, but a few have been etched with odd shimmering runes.  Two braziers burn
lowly near the northern wall, their golden flames emitting neither smoke nor
odor.  They flank an impressive pedestal which stands about four feet high
against the northern wall.  Runes of an unknown origin line the pedestal,
creating a strange series of snakes that twist their way from top to bottom.  
The only exit is up the stairs.    ~

Along a Wall of Thorned Bushes~
   &0 The plant life here seems to have gone amuck.  A thick wall of bushes
have sprouted up, encircling a massive section of the forest.  Their thick
thorn-covered branches weave together to create a impenetrable wall of foliage.
The rest of the forest is also quite dense in this region, with large clumps of
trees and wide spread underbrush in every direction.  The sound of singing
birds fill the air, as if they had nothing to do but create an endless chorus
for all eternity.    ~

as far as the eye can see.  Most of the sky is gone, replaced by a cluttered
canopy of green leaves.  To the west, a tall wall of thorned bushes is visible.
They stand guard, refusing to let anyone any farther in that direction.    ~

Along a Wall of Thorned Bushes~
   &0 The plant life here seems to have gone amuck.  A thick wall of bushes
have sprouted up, encircling a massive section of the forest.  Their thick
thorn-covered branches weave together to create a impenetrable wall of foliage.
The rest of the forest is also quite dense in this region, with large clumps of
trees and wide spread underbrush in every direction.  The sound of singing
birds fill the air, as if they had nothing to do but create an endless chorus
for all eternity.    ~

Deep Within the Forest~
   The sky rapidly disappears from view, replaced by the stretching branches of
ancient trees.  Their healthy leaves blanket the area in shade, protecting
against foul weather conditions.  Plants grow thickly between these massive
giants, creating a hardy underbrush that stretches along the forest's floor.  
Flowers bloom brightly in every direction, poking up from beneath the curtain
of ferns and other leafy plants.  Their sprinkling of color adds contrast to
the lush green backdrop.    ~

Hidden Niche Within the Thorned Bushes~
   Clinging branches armed with inch long thorns stab outwards at every angle,
trying their best to protect this hidden passage from view.  Combined with the
broad leaves from the bushes, this provides adaquate cover from the casual
glance.  As the trail leads even deeper into the forest's heart, bits of old
stone can be seen.  Some appear as nothing more then rocks, but others were
obviously part of some larger construction.  Ancient runes, long since faded
from comprehension, are now just barely visible on these stones.    ~

   The thick forest growth slowly breaks up, as the hidden passage opens onto a
sort of clearing.  Several young trees dot the grassy clearing, adding patches
of shade.  Many smaller plants grow along the clearing, but the larger bushes

Before a Collection of Ancient Druidic Stones~
   The wooded clearing finally comes to an end here at the forest's very
center.  Ancient oak trees line the heart, their bulky branches sprawling out
to cover the sky.  Dotted between these impressive trees, a collection of
standing stones can be seen.  Each is about eight feet tall, covered from top
to bottom with druidic symbols.  This is surely one of the power points of
nature.    ~

Deserted Path Within the Wooded Foothills~
   Deeper within the forest, it slowly begins to thin, opening up onto a faded
overgrown path.  Looming trees leap up on eitheer side of the path, casting
their shade and blocking out most of the sky.  The ground here is rough and
sloping, much like most of the other hills in this region.  Cracked rocks and
old stones line the path, as if some ancient ruins once existed in this forest.
The road is to the west and another path leads east into the forest.    ~

Overgrown Trail Deep Within the Forest~
   The trees once again begin to crowd the faded path, leaving little of it in
view at times.  Thick gnarled vines snake their way across the path, dangling
down from trees and across scattered boulders.  The amount of loose rock slowly
begins to increase, with more crumbling debris coming into view.  Far off to
the east, an unfamiliar mountain range is just visible through the thick
canopy.  The path splits off here, leading north, south, and west.    ~

A Circle of Standing Stones~
   &0 The forest breaks apart, revealing a wide clearing of sorts on a sloping
hillside.  At least a half dozen stone columns have ben arranged on the hill's
crest in a semi-circle, surrounding an ancient oak tree.  Ancient writing
covers most of these stones, etched into their rough surfaces several hundred
years ago.  It is apparent this place is important to the druids.  Perhaps it
is some point of power for communing with nature.    ~

whenever space permits.  Snaking vines, thorny bushes, and even mighty trees
prosper on the shores of this sweet smelling pool.  Its cool waters appear to
be quite deep, but clear and clean.    ~

   The forest opens up upon a small clearing, complete with a clear pool of
fresh water and several trimmed hedges.  Bushes and flowers of a wide variety
prosper here, probably due to the odd lack of coldness that usually plagues the
south.  A collection of proud standing stones encircles the pool, each at least
twelve feet tall.  Probably druidic in nature, these ancient monoliths could
have stood here for centuries.  This is obviously a place of great importance
to these druids.    ~

   The forest grows thick here, blanketing everything within its hold of green
life.  Plants of all sorts sprout of from the rich soil, spurred to life by the
wonders of nature.  Buried deep within the underbrush, a collection of large
stone chunks are visible.  They seem to have once belonged to an ancient column
or monolith.  Several more of these monoliths are visible, still intact
standing amongst the trees with an equal splendor.  Vines crawl up their sides,
providing protection from the casual search.  This appears to be some sort of
ancient power point, used to commune with nature by the druids.    ~

along the western coast.  Salt tainted winds blow in from the sea to the west,
carrying with them the scent of wide open waters and countless fish.  The
distant sounds of dancing waves and squawking seabirds fill the air, creating a
serene traveling song.  Thick blue grass lines the road sides, blowing in the
wind in a similiar fashion to the distant waves.    ~

ever northwards to the unseen peeks of the Wailing Mountains.  The road presses

momentarily leaves the water's side to cut across the land formation.  A simple
dirt road breaks off and heads westward, out towards the very tip of the
peninsula and to the town of Solta which can be located there.  To the north
and south, the road once again meets up with the coast.~

is an important port town.  It provides safe haven to the massive ships from
Lyania when a vicious storm hits the area and is often visited by several
exotic merchant ships.    ~

to the north, bringing the smell of snow to this lush forest.  The green
stretches out below the ridge, but up ehre only a few hardy pines grow.  A
light trail, hardly more than a deer track, runs from the south and then turns
west to descend the ridge.    ~

Ascent in the Forest~
   A faint path leads away from the forest sprites' dwelling and east into the
verdant woods, ascending a hill that slowly rises above the surrounding land.
The path is hardly visible beneath the ground cover, but it has been marked
with moss-covered stones of all sizes and varieties.  The smell of growing
plants is overpowering, but sound is muffled and does not travel far.    ~

Western Coastal Road Through the Rolling Hills~
   The scene to the west remains virtually unchanged, with the occasional sand
beach dotting the endless western coastline.  The waves are perhaps a bit
rougher, a foot or two higher when compared to the milder weather to the south.
To the east, the plains are slowly transforming into rolling hills.  The once
flat surface is sloping up and down, becoming rougher as the terrain sweeps
ever northwards to the unseen peeks of the Wailing Mountains.  The road presses
ever onwards, cutting through the terrain sparing little attention for the
changing environment.    ~

Western Coastal Road Cutting Across the Rugged Lands~
   As the Wailing Mountains barely become visible along the northern horizon,
the gently rolling hills begin to become more defined.  The lush green grasses
and sparse trees are slowly relpaced by the half-brown northland grass and
stunted foilage.  The weather becomes a bit colder, as freezing winds blow down
the very distant mountainside and roll across these rugged hills.  The road
continues on its determined path north and southward, running through whatever
stands in its path.    ~

Western Coastal Road Along Mount Nukreth's Base~
   Like a decaying fang of some vicious beast, Mount Nukreth juts upwards from
within the surrounding hills.  This lone peak looks oddly out of place, having
been formed from an unnatural-looking black rock.  Its base stretches on in all
dirctions and comes to rest about ten yards from the road's edge.  The peak's
very tip is hidden from view, though the sloping sides easily reach over a
thousand feet into the air.  Stunted black trees grow along Mount Nukreth, the
only living things that dare to come anywhere near its corrupted form.    ~

Western Coastal Road Cutting Across the Rugged Lands~
   As the Wailing Mountains barely become visible along the northern horizon,
the gently rolling hills begin to become more defined.  The lush green grasses
and sparse trees are slowly relpaced by the half-brown northland grass and
stunted foilage.  The weather becomes a bit colder, as freezing winds blow down
the very distant mountainside and roll across these rugged hills.  The road
continues on its determined path north and southward, running through whatever
stands in its path.    ~

Dirt Road Through the Eastern Plains~
   A well-maintained road showing signs of heavy usage, this trail leads from
Toldar's Keep in the north and curves around to meet Lake Fedis in the east.  
Favored over the harsher conditions of the caravan route through the Wailing
Mountains by larger parties and kept safe by the soldiers of the borderhold, it
is nonetheless vulnerable to attack by roving bands of barbarians, bandits and
orcs because of the rich temptation of a fat merchant caravan.  The Wailing
Mountains lie to the north, and another, unnamed mountain range can barely be
seen far to the south.    ~

Junction of Roads~
   The western coastal road finally comes to an end here, as it turns sharply
to the east and becomes more of a caravan route.  The giant range of peaks
known as the Wailing Mountains block any further passage to the north, their
dark looming height far too dangerous to be conquered by even the most brave of
travelers.  Despite this, it looks like an entrance has been carved into the
mountainside.  The carvan route leads far off to the east, heading along the
Wailing Mountains and their foothills, while the coastal road leads south.    ~

Caravan Route Along the Wailing Mountains~
   This winding road runs along the base of the Wailing Mountains, cutting
through the jagged foothills to create a rather solid road to travel upon.  
Mounds of snow and ice cover the mountain sides, sweeping down in sections to
overun part of the caravan route.  The occasional twisted pine can be seen on
the horizon, a lone sliver of life amongst the cold browns and whites.  A low,
constant wailing can be heard at all hours as wind blows through the
cave-ridden mountain peaks.    ~

it looks like this road doesn't get much traffic nowadays.  The road stretches

   This winding road runs along the base of the Wailing Mountains, cutting
through the jagged foothills to create a rather solid road to travel upon.  
Mounds of snow and ice cover the mountain sides, sweeping down in sections to
overun part of the caravan route.  The occasional twisted pine can be seen on
the horizon, a lone sliver of life amongst the cold browns and whites.  A low,
constant wailing can be heard at all hours as wind blows through the
cave-ridden mountain peaks.    ~

Caravan Route Through a Copse of Pine Trees~
   The sudden appearance of trees is quite a change from the cold brown and
white hills that dominate this area.  The tall dark forms of ancient pines leap
up from the rough ground, their thick trunks mere feet apart as if they crowd
together for warmth.  The caravan road leads right through this densly
populated forest.  Ancient tree stumps line the road, the work of barbarian
woodsmen.    ~

Near a Fortified Borderhold~
   The hills flatten out a bit here, coming upon a small valley leading down to
the eastern plains.  Winding out of the foothills, the caravan route runs right
up to the west gate of a military stronghold to the east.  Its high stone walls
are decorated with minor damage, trophies of their previous battles.  The keep
guards the caravan route, protecting it from marauders prowling its length.  
To the north, the Wailing Mountains rise into the clouds, their chilly peaks
accessible through a pass somewhere to the east.  Plains lie to the south, and
a road can be seen running through them to the southeast.    ~

Before the Borderhold's Western Gates~
   The west gate of the borderhold looks somewhat newer than the knicked gray
stone walls stretching out on either side of its reinforced iron doors.  
Standing several lengths higher than the walls on either side of the gate, the
steel-barred doors are cast from massive single pieces of iron.  They swing
outwards on strong reinforced hinges capable of holding the strongest battering
ram at bay.  A small wooden shack sits just to the side of the dirt caravan
route that stretches off into the distance to the west.    ~

Before the Borderhold's Eastern Gates~
   The caravan route comes to an abrupt end here, running right up to the huge
iron gates of the borderhold.  Still keeping some of their original casting's
shine, the gates look somewhat newer than the drab gray stone walls running out
on either side of the gates.  Massive bars of steel reinforce the gates, locked
into ponderous steel hinges running up and down each side of the gate.  The
ground to the north is quite rocky, approaching the base of the Wailing
Mountains.~

   The forest starts to thicken just off the eastern side of the road, and
grows even denser at it travels eastward.  Thorny bushes line the narrow dirt
trail that leads between the trees, forcing all but the most enduring of
wanders to stay upon the set course.  Oddly enough, no birds can be heard
singing within the trees, and no squirrels leap from branch to branch.  There
appears to be no sound of life at all, except for the occasional rustle of some
far off branch.  Few people are foolish enough to travel within Fangron Forest,
avoiding its wicked depths at all costs.    ~

   Shadows creep their way along the forest, as the trees grow closer together
and weave their branches into a thick canopy above.  The ground has little
vegetation, save for the occasional patch of moss or even fern that absorbs
what little sunlight it can get.  Thick strands of webbing cover most of the
surrounding plant life, laid down by some monstrous spider.  Some have been
strung between branches to trap unwary travelers as they walk the paths.  
Other webs just lie across the ground to trap creatures that step upon them.  
The webs create a ghost-like mist over the area, adding to the eerie

Below a Twisted Tree Trunk~
   The thick forest clears a bit, creating a small field about twenty paces
across.  In the very center of this clearing, a fat twisted tree stretches
upwards to mingle its thick collection of branches with the other trees high
above in the canopy.  Webbing covers most of the clearing, stringing its way up
the trunk as well.  The thick white substance is much like the webs left by
spiders, but the amount present would take millions of tiny spiders to create.~

Webbed Section of Fangron Forest~
   Shadows creep their way along the forest, as the trees grow closer together
and weave their branches into a thick canopy above.  The ground has little
vegetation, save for the occasional patch of moss or even fern that absorbs
what little sunlight it can get.  Thick strands of webbing cover most of the
surrounding plant life, laid down by some monstrous spider.  Some have been
strung between branches to trap unwary travelers as they walk the paths.  
Other webs just lie across the ground to trap creatures that step upon them.  
The webs create a ghost-like mist over the area, adding to the eerie
surroundings.    ~

Fangron Forest~
   The forest starts to thicken just off the eastern side of the road, and
grows even denser at it travels eastward.  Thorny bushes line the narrow dirt
trail that leads between the trees, forcing all but the most enduring of
wanders to stay upon the set course.  Oddly enough, no birds can be heard
singing within the trees, and no squirrels leap from branch to branch.  There
appears to be no sound of life at all, except for the occasional rustle of some
far off branch.  Few people are foolish enough to travel within Fangron Forest,
avoiding its wicked depths at all costs.    ~

Into the Thick Canopy~
   Several thick strands of webbing, and the odd angular shape of the nearby
trunks make it easy to ascend into the tree tops from this point.  Thick bunches
of leaves hang down from above, blanketing everything with their lush green
life.  Webs also are visible, strung up from every available branch.  The trunk
continues upwards, into the canopy above.    ~

Forest Canopy Strung with Thick Webs~
   Webs line this whole area, hanging from branches at every angle.  They drape
downwards to create vicious nets that could ensnare something the size of a
horse with little problem.  Vast lines of cocoons hang from these webs, some of
which still twitch with a living being inside.  However, most contain empty
husks, long since drained of all their life fluids.  This massive collection of
webs leads off along the canopy.    ~

Winding Path Down to a Gravel Beach~
&0   A small dirt path branches off from the main road, and heads towards
the gravel path to the west. It slopes downwards, as it makes a trail across
a steep hill. A few weeds grow along the path, mostly an odd variety of brown
grass that can survive the harsh northern weather. Farther to the west, a
sweeping gravel beach can be seen spreading itself out along the coastline.~

A Gravel Beach~
   The wide gravel beach spreads over most of this area, its surface covered
with a thick layer of stones broken down from the nearby hills and cliffs.  
These rocks are mostly gray in color, sharp and uncomfortable to walk on.  A
few, however, gleam with an assortment of ores and bits of worthless metal that
create a nice luster.  The sea to the west is rough, with huge waves crashing
at random intervals against the stone beach.  A cold breeze is almost
constantly blowing in from the water, carrying with it the scent of salt and
the sound of seabirds.  Far to the north, a series of cliffs are visible.    ~

Gravel Beach Leading Towards the Cliffs~
   The sheer rock face of a massive cliff blocks towers just to the east of
this beach section.  Massive waves have pounded against its rough surface for
ages, creating countless indentations and small caves.  The gravel beach leads
along this cliff, heading northward to come to face a rocky wall.  Crashing
water stretches off to the west as far as the eye can see, its deep blue
coloring similiar to that of a storm-ridden night.  The beach continues off to
the south, spreading out to almost thirty feet across.    ~

   The rocky beach leads right up to this cliff face, coming to an end before
the blackish stone wall.  Its rough surface is soaked from the misty spray that
is created by the nearby waves crashing against rocky pillars.  A gaping hole
has been formed near the center of this cliff wall, its blackened entrance
almost invisible behind cone-like rocks that jab upwards from the gravel beach.~

A Narrow Tunnel in the Rocky Cliff~
   This narrow tunnel is barely six feet across, its rough stone walls hinting
at its natural origin.  Most likely formed by the nearby waves crashing against
the cliff, the cave must have existed here for centuries.  The dark walls are

A Cavern of Stygian Mosaics~
   Mosaics from a countless number of dark religions line the walls of this
cavern, their art sweeping from one end to the other in an endless scene of
darkness. Vile demons and devils are portrayed committing profane acts upon
the forces of good and evil alike. Flashing claws tear into exposed flesh,
stinging fangs biting into the defenseless. There are drawings on the uneven
rock wall.  Most seem to have been drawn with dyes, chalk, and paint, but a
few have been etched in blood, probably the life fluids of some innocent
victim fallen to the monstrosities that created this hellish art.~

Before an Unholy Bonfire~
   Snaking tendrils of sapphire flame lick up from the bonfire built into the
cavern's center.  The tendrils twirl and dance, spurred on by some unseen
force.  Puffs of black smoke leak from the unholy flame, carrying with it the
odor of scorched flesh and exotic herbs.  The smoke curls up towards the
ceiling, only to be quickly engulfed by a passing breeze.  A few chunks of
driftwood are visible within the blue and black flames, but the main fuel seems
to be the severed limbs of some unfortunate humanoid.  Several scattered bones,
scorched black from heat, lie nearby in a heap, past victims of this corrupted
fire.  The cavern can be seen in all directions, illuminated with bizarre
shadows from the raging bonfire.    ~

A Cavern of Stygian Mosaics~
   Mosaics from a countless number of dark religions line the walls of this
cavern, their art sweeping from one end to the other in an endless scene of
darkness. Vile demons and devils are portrayed committing profane acts upon
the forces of good and evil alike. Flashing claws tear into exposed flesh,
stinging fangs biting into the defenseless. There are drawings on the uneven
rock wall.  Most seem to have been drawn with dyes, chalk, and paint, but a
few have been etched in blood, probably the life fluids of some innocent
victim fallen to the monstrosities that created this hellish art.~

A Bloodied Shrine~
   This fallen shrine has been devoted to the fallen gods, the unholy entities
of chaos.  Foul symbols of this perverse religion hang from the cavern walls
between painted images of the dark gods and their servitors.  The altar itself
is crafted from stone and a black metal.  It is covered with dried chipping
blood, remains from the last victim of the cult that dwells nearby.    ~
