One of the countless things that the Internet has introduced is the rampant
abuse of the exclamation point.  Before blogs, IMs, and message boards, the 
"."-to-"!"  Ratio was something like 100-to-1.  Now that we're in the   
"OMG!!!!LOL!!!!!!"-days, it's hard enough to find a single punctuation
mark, let alone a period.

Thankfully, there's still some sanity left.  Some people are so fed up with
this overuse that they refuse to use the exclamation point anywhere.  For
anything.  Even when writing code.  Sure, it may make their code look a bit
strange, but every little bit counts...

/**
 * @@return  true | false
 * @@param $val bool The bool to invert
 * @@desc Returns the
 */
function invert_bool($val){
  if($val == true)
    return false;
  if($val == false)
    return true;
}

subject: IDEA: add thread functionality to boards; archive command
message:
It would be cool if it were possible for players to reply to posts on boards,
and we could show the whole message thread together.

Another idea: add a 'board move <src> <dest>' to move posts from one board
from one board to another.  Maybe allow referencing specific post numbers
so we wouldn't have to move all the messages at once.  Something like
    board move mortal:1-25 archive
    board move mortal:26 spam
    board move quest qhistory

Also, it would be nice if the /f and /fi commands were paragraph-aware.
