Alrighty folks... here's the rundown as best I can recall
from a host of threads on the forums... AND the manual I had
rewritten back in 2k2

Requirements:
* You must have at least a minimum of 5 charter members
&0    Founders need to be active, if ever they become inactive then
&0    a replacement founder must be chosed before dues are collected
&0    or face disbandment.

* Guilds must have a charter of guiding principles and reason for
&0    existing.  This should include races, classes, alignment
&0    restrictions as well as goals of the guild, rules/laws
&0    and so forth.

* All guild members must be at least level twenty-five (25) or over.

- Fees and Dues -

* Initial setup is 15K platinum for starting the guild.
&0    The initial fee inclues a building permit for a 
&0    two (2) room hall of the the guild's design and local.
&0    (Some restrictions may apply)

* Additional rooms are 3k platinum each

* Guild equipment is as follows:
&0    - 3k platinum per basic item.
&0    - 5k platinum per +1 improved ability
&0    - 7k platinum per +1 improved ac
&0    - 12k platinum per +1 charge of x spell

&0    (equipment must be modeled after items commonly found throughout
&0    the realms, excluding deity or quest items and no equipment should
&0    retain permenant ability such as stoneskin, sneak, hide, haste, etc)

Dues are calculated by taking 10% of the overall guild construction cost
including extra rooms, items, etc. and are to be paid by the 5th of
every month.  Any guild that fails to pay their dues will have sixty
(60) days to pay the balance in full or have their guild disbanded
and any personal guild effects confiscated.

subject: Official Remort Rules
message:
Please note that as of right now, there are very few people who can actually
start you on one of these quests, so it may take a while for a request to be processed.
 
Rules for Remort
 
Qualifying for Remorting
Any persons looking to remort must fit the following qualifications.
1) One remort char will be allowed for each person at the following intervals:
4 completed chars, one of each base class type
9 completed chars
14 completed chars
17 completed chars, meaning one of each class (at this stage the only restriction
is that only 1 char may remort at a time).  By "completed", it means a **
character with all possible quest spells (if applicable, obviously an
assassin doesn't have quest spells).
 
2) The questee must prove their knowledge of the realm by answer 10 mud
knowledge questions from a list of 100. These will be randomly chosen and
given after verfication of other qualifications.
 
3) The char that shall be remorted must have a minimum of 2 weeks (336 hours).
Playtime with all other "completed" chars is a minimum of 100 hours playtime.
 
4) Must not have any outstanding quests on any chars. You may not start new
spell/eq quests while one of your characters is on a remort quest, except
spell quests for the remort character.
 
 
Remort Rules
1) A grouping restriction of no more than 5 levels above the remorting char
shall remain in effect. This includes help of any kind such as transportion
such as moonwells and CR such as res and shift corpse and support such as
invis, stone etc... However, feel free to group with those within the accepted
level range, which includes all characters of lower level than the remort.
 
2) To be considered "completed" in regards to the remort the char must re-quest
for and complete ALL possible spell quests. (Quests are considered part of
leveling up a char and thus must be completed during remort as well.)
 
Failure to comply with these rules will be a demotion back to level 1 and no
benifits upon regaining ** status. In other words, failing to respect these
rules is failing to respect the remort quest and result in revoke of the priviledge.
 
Reward for a Successfully Completed Remort
The character will be given:
 
1) All maxed stats.
 
2) All maxed skills for their class. Spells must be re-quested for as noted
in the Rules section.
 
3) 50% additional HP (based on their L99 hp before maxed stats and without
eq). This means that if you have 950 as a ** without eq before remorting,
your bonus would be 475 for a new total of 1475 (assuming you rolled the
same amount of hp the second time through).
 
4) The person shall be given access to the evil races choices for their next
char set. You may still quest for evil characters in the usual way, but this
is an added bonus for completing the remort quest.
 
 
 
If there are any questions, please contact your local Deity for more information.~

Does anybody know where the mielikki artifact might be?
I touched the Ickle artifact there, and now when I recall or die, 
I go to Ickle.
I would like to reclaim Mielikki as my home town, since it is
much more centrally located.
I swear I have touched everything in town, including the gazebo and
everything in the memorial garden, including the black rose bush.
nothing happens
If you know please mudmail Korah or Tolbrj.

message:
The Fiery Triathlon starts this Thursday night (March 8) at 8:00 PM
MST and culminates Sunday night (march 11) at 6:00 PM MST.  It will
consist of three speed leveling challenges.  Participants will compete
using new characters to attempt to be named Fiery's fastest!

All participants will receive rewards and winners will receive their
choice from a set of predetermined quest equipment, permanent stat
increases, race change on one of their characters.

There will be three separate competitions, which will occur in order.
The first competition will be 70 Hours long, beginning March 8 and
finishing March 11.  The next two competitions will be much shorter
and both occur the night of March 11, starting at 6PM MST.

As mentioned above, all participants will receive rewards and winners
of each competition will receive prizes.  Points will also be awarded
to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places in each competition, and players with the
highest point totals at the end of the night will receive another prize!

The specific competitions will occur as follows (no real relation
between the names and the actual challenges):

1) The Swimming Challenge (regular leveling)
This is an ordinary character leveling contest.  Players must create
new characters on or after March 8 at 8 PM MST, and may not group   
with characters created before the beginning of the contest.  At the end
of the 70 hours, the character with the highest level will win.  Players
need to create their characters on the night of March 8, and they
must register their characters to be eligible to win.

2) The Running Challenge (newbie leveling)
Players must create new characters.  A 1-level grouping restriction
will be in effect.  The first player to level 10 wins the match.
Small prizes will also be awarded for the first players to reach level 2
and level 5.

3) The Biking Challenge (endgame leveling)
Players must create new characters or reuse characters from the
newbie challenge
participants will be set to level 98 and may choose
a subclass.  Players may use two characters in tandem. The winner will   be the 
first player to reach ** on all characters they are playing.  Players will  receive a 
predetermined set of equipment, including weapons, armor, and pre-scribed spellbooks.

Further rules may be posted during the competitions.  Violations of
the posted rules as stated will result in immediate disqualification
from all three challenges.  Violations of the spirit of the rules will
be dealt with on a case-by-case basis by Lokari.

All prizes will be awarded at the end of the competition on or after March 11.
Posted information is subject to change at the gods' discretion. If you have 
any ideas, questions, or problems with the times, don't hesitate to post!~

March 8, when the quest begins.

Participants may NOT have any help at all from any characters
not in the quest. This means you may only work with
or receive help from the other triathletes (not their
alts or yours),

This Includes:

*ITEMS, WEAPONS, POTIONS, SCROLLS, MONEY
and other things along that same spirit

*GROUPING (with any one not questing)

*ANY magical or non-magical support corpse returns,
moonwells, corpse shifts, or buffs of any kind from any 
one not questing breaking this rule will be disqualified.

*WEAKENING mobs or areas intentionally to make the
experience easier for the questing characters.

Participaping players will need to notify Ramah to include
them in the quest. (Sending Ramah a petition or mudmail 
will suffice for this requirement

Players may use as many characters as they please, in 
this quest.These characters may subclass and do 
in-game quests. You will be able to keep these characters
after the quest is over.

The quest will end at 6PM MST on March 11.  At this time,
the highest-leveled participant in the quest will be
declared the winner.

Each player with a participating character of at level 15
(this may be adjusted at Ramahs discretion) when the
quest ends will receive 20 quest points.  The winner of this 
challenge will receive an additional 25 quest points for
a total of 45.

Ramah and Yuhen will be keeping track of players' quest points.
They are not transferable, but may be redeemed after the quests 
are over,look for prizes listed to be listed on the board.  ~

Here is my take on the Admin/Imm/Gods/Bosses

Yuhen= Nice, Kind, Hard working. forgetful. Yuhen seems like a person who used to be a player and will go out of his way to assist the mortals

Ramah= Stern, forceful, Works to much, Will spend time on things. Ramah may always be here, but is never here. Always AFK doing IMM things but also friendly but mean. He's the Ying/Yang Imm

Zzur= Unknown. Zzur... Zzur is.... Never here. 'nuff said

Those are the 3 Main Imm's as of late. No idea why but there is no Coders... That needs to change.

Home of the Illusionist
This is a large, pleasant room, beautifully inlaid with mahogany and papered
with soothing designs.  There is no trace or sign of dirt, clutter, or
imperfection anywhere.  Lilies sit in amber vases on small marble tables while
sconces burn smokelessly on either side of the crackling fire.  It is dark, but
not oppressively so
there is room and time to think.  An exit leads north.
Obvious exits: -N
A swirling moonwell ripples across your sight, leading to the unknown. (hovering)
Erasmus sits by the fire gazing attentively at the flames.

So I've read the news and found that Zzur is retiring from fiery.
What is needed to host fiery and keep it going? It seems a little
sad that something that has been so good for such a long time

message:
So, Zzur is retiring, we can't do much about that.  It think we can all agree that
Zzur has been a benevolent creator, and tireless God.  I know I will hate to see him go.
Hopefully, he can stop by and see us from time to time.

Wait, did you catch that ?  How will Zzur stop and see us, if Fiery closes on the 28th ?

Well that's the good news.  I have a server, and Zzur has transfered Fiery over.
I can't guarantee I'll keep Fiery running as long as Zzur has, but I'll do my best.
We have a little more work to get All of Fiery over and running, but I'm confident 
we will have the new server up and everyone moved by Zzur's Retirement date.

There won't be any name changes, or anything like that, you'll still go to fierymud.org
to reach us, and it will still run 24X7.  As far as format goes, I don't expect much
to change.  and I  hope we can keep our current rate of enhancements going.  
Yuhen and Ramah have done an excellent job building new areas as of late. 

I am open to all suggestions, Just as Zzur has always been.  I don't care how 
dumb the idea sounds, if you think it's cool, someone else might too, so pass it along.
I will say my area of expertise is more web-based, and I am considering adding some 
web-based functionality to Fiery.  I haven't dug into it all deep enough to comment
on what that might be just yet, but if you have ideas for enhancements, please pass them on.

I can always be reached at chinok@@fierymud.org .  The other gods are
usually quick to answer email as well.

Please remind and encourage your friends to come back and see us.

Hi Fiery peeps.
Hope you have found the new server hospitable and warm, 
and not too many dragons have eaten you since our move :)

We are currently looking at types of equipment that may be lacking.
for example, there's not a lot of eye-wear in the game.
We are actively working on coming up with some new equipment, and 
placing it in places that make sense.  If you have suggestions

Callum.  Callum was a healthy boy who weighed in at 3.97kg (8lb12oz)
and was 51cm (20") tall.

We have had a few days recovering in hospital and are home now as
a family and learning the new ways of the world.  So far we are

subject: Keeping the MUD alive
message:
   There's a certain element of imaginative thinking that has been lost on
this current generation of young people.  I have tried to introduce people to
this game numerous times and I get laughed at.  People these days just don't
want to have to think or imagine for themselves a fantasy world that can
transcend that of the modern graphical computer games.  There is a certain
type of person that will play this MUD and they tend to, generally speaking,
congregate towards one another.  Meaning, if you play this MUD, then chances
are you know someone who plays it already, or would play it if they got the
right kind of persuasion.  That said, I am asking all of you to take the time
one of these days to make a new fieryMUD friend.  Introduce someone, teach
them, play with them, market the MUD.  And truth be told, We need immortals to
begin working the MUD.  If you are interested in being a part of the holy
imms, then MUDmail chinok so he can hook you up with the details.~

A month or two ago, I found a relatively active mud 'forum' and I suggested
to someone who was looking for a mud to try here.  I'm not sure if they did or
not (that specifically is besides the point) but a couple of weeks later, they did
a kind of weekly forum 'let's this this MUD!' sort of a thing and they chose Fiery.
I had happened to logon and there was a bunch of new players running around and
I offered to help as much as I could but couldn't really stick around.  

Long story short, I talked to some of the players afterwards about what they though.
Most found Fiery to be not very new player friendly and had trouble getting answers
questioned from lack of help files and the like.  Personally, I don't think that's true
but I've also been playing here for 15 years so I'm a little biased and know my way around.
Just some food for thought mostly.  I
will try to track down the things they said and maybe send you the link.

Anyway, it's cool that you're being proactive at trying to keep this place alive.  It's been a
long time.

I am lucky enough to have been on vacation for the past couple weeks
decided to come back to Fiery to ease my (relaxation?) boredom...
found some really cool people still playing, had some good convos
with Yuhen and Chinok, and i was actually quite impressed with
how hard people are working to keep Fiery active.

I've been playing like Devon (er Nevd) for about the past 20 years
Started as Esteban (warrior) and Fortune (cleric), immed for a while
disappeared after teh big crash, and have been logging in on and off
for quite a long time.  My most recent foray was probably in late90s
and early 2000s, had Arreeleo (antipaladin) and a number of support
characters, i think 33 or 34**s, at least one of every class

I just wanted to say hi to all the oldies I haven't seen yet while
here for the last couple weeks, and to say thanks for not letting
Fiery die.  I'm sorry to see Feyd go, Zzur, whatever you want to call
him, and i do miss the comraderie.  Miss Pergus too.. RIP

Hopefully i can continue to stop by, evn though I restart my 
55 hour work weeks on Monday, Jan 6.  It would be great to hear
from you guys if you're still around, and just laying dormant
until the rebirth of our 70+ population list haha

message:
   Yuhen and i would like to invite the players to contribute ideas for a new
help file page that will help newbies pick useful character pairs/sets.  If
you would like to contribute please email your thoughts to ramah(at)fierymud.
Org .  Feel free to input anything about good sets you wish you had known when
you were new.  Be sure to include your ideas for great, good, and bad sets as
well as the character name you wish to be know as in the help file.

&bCHARACTER SETS

   Each class or subclass has its own strengths and weaknesses.  This page has
been created to help players early on to make effective character sets.  
These are some of the sets players have found to be worthwhile, followed by
some less-inspiring match-ups, along with some explanations.

   3 star sets favorites of many players : sets that give you a well rounded
team as well as a full gaming experience.
   * necro and thief (having a thief to see your zombies inventory is super
helpful)
   * paladin and sorcerer (paladin is a great tank and can keep himself alive
and the sorcerer can crank out damage safe from harm)

   2 star sets boring but effective sets : these are still good sets but you
might limit your gameplay experience because of your set
   * druid and sorcerer (funny but no one will take you seriously)

   1 star sets unimpressive sets : it is important to state that there are no
bad groups but.  You might want to avoid.  Any set that is the same class, any
set that has conflicting alignments.
   * paladin/anti and priest/dia (so much overlap in character strengths and
weaknesses that it leaves a lot to be desired)
   * Solo, doesnt matter what class.  (most classes can get by, but its
painfully slow and eventually not as fun or capable as teamwork)

A special thanks to the players namely (&2your name here&0) for contributing
to the helpfile of fierymud~

feel the same way about all the time that was passed since we all started... you and I (Ermenegildo) used to group as newbs and do Sunken runs.
I believe I'm still admin of the group "Fierymud Fans" or "Fans of Fierymud" on Facebook if anyone wants to connect.
I still keep in touch with Mecke et al and Gung et al on there.
This is my first time signing on in a couple years. 
Hope to see some peeps on next time. I'll check back in a week or so. Cheers!~

message:
   Gonna try this one again.  

   Greetings all ye seekers of fiery glory and death!  I know I havent been
here for quite some time.  I was hoping to remedy that somewhat.  If you have
never heard of discord, its like instant messenger, meets teamspeak meets
skype plus lots lots more.  For those that care to join, it is free btw, i
will post a link down at the bottom.  Benefits include the ability to speak to
other player characters using voice activated chat, having quicker and more
reliable access to imms, (so far Chinok and I are the only ones there), and
the latest news and updates related to MUDding.  

   So what do you have to lose by joining?  Did I mention the free part?  
Plus, there are many other discord servers out there for every imaginable
purpose you can think of.  And so much more besides!  
So come on in. link below.
https://discord.gg/guyvjxf

-Venath

   Ps.  In case it wasn't made clear, I am offering better access to mortals
who wish to play for imm items, quest spells or skills.  It will be easier for
you to get that elusive spell quest.  Trust me.  I'm there alot.~

subject: December 14 Equipment update info
message:
Big changes have come to Fiery's equipment!
Second, armor and weapon restrictions have been changed across the game!
- We have made an attempt to divide armor and weapons into several 
  conceptual categories:
1. All objects are either natural (including purely magical) or forged
2. Armors are heavy (forged metals, rock/stone), 
   medium (wood, dragonscale, bone, chainmail, scalemail, ringmail), 
   light (leather, fabric, plant, fur, hair, feather, paper, magic/
   elemental), or shields.
3. Weapon types are: dagger, shortsword (includes most pickaxes), 
   and 1 or 2 handed versions of sword, spear, axe (includes most scythes
   and sickles), mace/hammer, club, and staff.
- Many accessories have had their class restrictions removed, 
  but alignment restrictions tightened.
- Daggers, 1h clubs, and 1h staves are now usable by any class, although
  many unique or esoteric weapons remain exclusive to particular skill lines,
  religions, or mystical practices.
- These categories are NOT hard-coded.  There may be errors or oversights, 
  but there's also conceptual or practical wiggle room.  
 
- Let us know what you think!
- After decades of being free to wear anything they want, Monks are now 
  subject to gear restrictions just like everyone else. They are now 
  restricted from most armors of chainmail weight and heavier, nor can
  they use shields of any kind anymore.  Furthermore, they are no longer
  capable of wielding most weapons even if they want to for some reason.
  This may result in a complete overhaul of a Monk's gear.
- Rogues, Thieves, and Assassins may now use most single-handed swords and
  shields.  Rogues and Thieves are limited to lighter armor, but 
  Assassins can wear full chain.
- Mercenaries cannot wear most heavy forged armors anymore, but can use any 
  type of weapon.
- Sorcerers, Pyromancers, and Cryomancers should now find knowing what they 
  can and cannot wear a little more intuitive.  They can only use armor made
  from very light or highly magical materials; they can use fur, but not 
  leather.  Except in a few rare instances, they cannot use 
  shields anymore either.
- Necromancers have nearly identical restrictions to Sorcerers now.  For 
  years, much of the earliest gear lacked the Necromancer restriction 
  because it was developed before the class was implemented.  We were
  sure to correct most of those oversights on this pass.
- Clerics, Priests, and Diabolists may now use most armors and shields.
  Although they can now use most daggers, they do not have the piercing 
  weapon proficiency.  They still cannot use swords, axes, or spears.
- Druids now have the most conceptual limitations on their equipment.  
  They can now use nearly anything made of a natural or purely magical 
  substance, provided it doesn't interfere with their alignment.  Any 
  one-handed weapon that may be useful in gardening, harvesting, or 
  hunting can also now be used.  Larger weapons and swords are still 
  off-limits to them.
- Rangers have been caught in paradigm shifts for years.  We're currently 
  treating them as moderately-armored hunters with all the weapon 
  prowess of Warriors.
Future projects:
- By and large items have NOT been rebalanced yet.  This is the next project 
  we'll be working on in the background.
- Weapon damage messages may also be inconsistent (eg some shortswords are 
  pierce, some are slash).  We hope to align that soon, since that does play
  a significant role for Rogue-types, particularly Assassins.
- We're hoping to make gearing more consistent across the leveling 
  experience by adjusting items to reflect the level of the zones they
  come from.  We'll be adjusting both item levels and item strength to 
  accomplish that."~

subject: Recent XP scale changes
message:
Hope you all read the news!&_
If you did, you know we updated the XP scales for several classes.
Previously, Pyros, Cryos, Paladins, and Antis all needed the standard 100% experience.
Paladins and Antis now need 115%, equivalent to Rangers, and Pyros and Cryos need 120%, the same as base Sorcerer.
We increased these numbers because these classes previously needed /less/ XP to level than their base classes, 
despite having equivalent or better abilities.&_
Monks needed 150% because of all their abilities and the lack of gear restriction.
Having added that restriction though, we have reduced their XP scale to 130%.
Monks immediately saw their levels go up as their current XP totals were matched to the new level values.&_
A small problem we did not foresee however was what would happen to all the ** characters of classes who we adjusted upward.&_
Although we changed their XP scales, unlike with Monks,
all these characters stayed at their current XP total of 100% instead of the new maximums AND also their current level.
If/when they die, their level is still 99, so they lose 25% of the new expected amount from the 115% or 120% scale,
rather than 25% of the previous 100% scale.
Also as it turns out, the amount of experience you need to get from 99 to ** for all classes is /astronomical/.
It's roughly equivalent to the experience needed to get from halfway through level 96 to 99.
So this new much larger amount is subtracted from the existing much lower total,
then the game does the normal thing to check what level the new XP total should be and sets the character to that.
This results in level 99 players losing 4-5 levels at their first death,
which is exactly what would happen to some Monks after they subclassed previously.&_
It also means it is going to take some time before the experience meter starts increasing again -
being at less experience than the level minimum isn't something we ever planned for it to indicate!&_
I apologize for the bump in the roll out on this.
Some of you are upset.  I fully empathize with your dissatisfaction.
But I promise you, soon you won't even notice the difference!&_

Just wanted to let you all know that yes, Illusionist is live and you can subclass to it!
The quest master is an old long-time enemy Master near Mielikki.


 
However the two signature spells, Phantasm and Simulacrum, aren't quite working yet.
We're on it though!
 
Also, Illusionist hasn't had its XP scale adjusted upward yet.
Once that change goes live, find me online and I can get you fixed up!

subject: ** XP follow-up
message:
I need to point out the amount of experience to get from level 99 to ** has ALWAYS been enormous.
Even before the recent changes, it was 2.5 levels of experience.  This has not changed at all.
The only difference is how many points 2.5 levels of experience is.
If you feel this is too punishing, you're welcome to talk to a god about a solution.

subject: More Gear Changes Ahead
message:
As you may have noticed, Fiery is going through some revamping behind the scenes.
I wanted to give you a heads up about one that is going to impact all of you:
Equipment stat changes!
 
This overhaul is long overdue.
With the successful implementation of the !monk bit, we're finally in a place to 
make some minor to moderate changes in the stats of most of the gear.
 
Our goal with this is /not/ to nerf all the existing equipment.
Our goal /is/ to make more equipment more competitive.
 
I hope to accomplish four things:
1. Create a more steady progression from level to level with gear growth
2. Make the hierarchy of what is better than what more intuitive - 
(steel should generally offer greater protection than mundane leather, for example)
3. Make gear more appropriate to the level of the zone it comes from - 
(no more level 50 1d8 longswords)
4. Reduce redundancy of item names and stats and make sure items have substantial
differences,
both in name and function.
 
Some items in the mid levels will see their effectiveness reduced a point or two.
Many weapons will see a small to significant increase in their damage.
End game gear will be largely unaffected, save a few items that still need more of
a kick to be rewarding for the effort it takes to get them.
Some items currently best in the game for some classes will see their levels
dramatically increased so you aren't getting the best gear at level 30.
This should hopefully be commensurate with the practical challenge it to get them. 
 
Any gear currently in existence will NOT be affected.
If you have it, it's yours and it can't be changed unless you get it altered at the
repair shop or by a god.
 
I can't give an exact timeline other than "soon", but know the planning is well underway
and I hope to start rolling this out in the low-level zones soon.
 
If you have questions or comments, please feel free to chat with me in game or email me

subject: Player Poll: Races!
message:
We're looking to make some modifications to the current races and I would
love the input of the player base on this.
 
Of the races you currently play, what do you feel is lacking?
What would you like to see changed, improved, removed, or created?
We have ideas already under development, but I want to make sure you all
feel included in these decisions.
 
Other than Elves and Drow, are there any races you would be interested in
playing, be it a general type of thing you think is missing, or something
very specific.  I have many ideas I'm interested in pursuing, but not
everything I think is what's best for everyone, so please, give me your
ideas!
 
Additionally, let me know what you think about any of the following
playable races:
 
Faeries (flying, enhanced magic, one good variety one evil variety)
Nymph (blinding beauty and high charisma)
Tree Folk (like Ents/Treants, but smaller!)
Genasi (one for each element, descendants of elementals, genies, and similar
planar beings)
Kobolds (are they pig-dogs or tiny dragon people?  Your call!)
Gnolls (Hyena-men with axes!)
Tieflings (humanoid descendants of demons and devil)
Aasimar (humanoid descendants of angels and celestials)
Centaur (I dunno, maybe you can ride them?)

 
In any case, please share your thoughts with me, either in conversation,
or via email at daedela@@fierymud.org.  I look forward to hearing from you!

message:
A new race has appeared in Ethilien!
The Dragonborn, the bipedal descendants of the humanoid races and mighty dragons, are
ready for play testing!
 
There are five types of Dragonborn, each associated with a different breath weapon.
That's right, player races now have access to breath weapons!
Player breath weapons have cooldowns so you can't spam them.
Their damage is determined by a skill which is currently not working quite right
We should have the skills corrected in the next few days.
 
The breath weapons are currently not trainable either, but we'll get that fixed up soon.
 
The help files aren't updated to reflect this new race yet, but we'll get that in soon.
 
Dragonborn can be any of the following classes/subclasses:
Sorcerer
Cleric
Warrior
Paladin
Anti-Paladin
Necromancer
Priest
Diabolist
Pyromancer (except for Frost Dragonborn)
Cryomancer (except for Fire Dragonborn)
Illusionist
Please, go and try out our new draconic humanoid cousins!

message:
The patch this month brings in a number of sweeping changes for Fiery.  
 
&3&bNEW CLASS: BERSERKER!&0
&7&bBerserker is now officially enabled for play!&0
   - Allowable races are barbarian, dwarf, duergar, ogre, orc, and 
     troll.
   - Berserker is a subclass of warrior, following all the standard 
     subclass rules.
   - The subclass master is waiting up near the barbarian homelands in 
     the far north.
   - Berserker is intended as a high-damage, low-defense class.  The 
     signature characteristic, Rage, causes berserkers to become 
     aggressive to all targets, increases damage by 10%, but also 
     causes the character to take 10% more damage.
   - !Berserker has been added as a restriction on gear.  In general,  
     berserkers can use any weapon, but are restricted to light and  
     medium armor.
   - Berserkers have four guild halls throughout the world, and a 
     unique set of phase armor quests!
   - Berserkers also have access to the Chant skill for war chants and 
     other kinds of battle buffs, and the Meditation skill to help 
     them quickly regain their Rage.
 
From new !class flags, you'll also notice another class is in active 
development now too: &5&bBard&0.  We hope to release this class in the 
next few months.
 
 
&3&bRACIAL UPDATES&0
We made some racial balance tweaks to help each race be a little more 
unique.
 
&7&bTrolls and ogres had a difficult relationship for a long time.&0
   - Ogres were unparalleled in their front line combat capabilities 
     and vastly outshine trolls. Ogres have had their maximum hit 
     points and Constitution scores reduced, along with their AC 
     factor, while maintaining their Strength and damage roll 
     modifiers. 
   - Trolls have had their damage slightly reduced while pumping their 
     Constitution and hit point maximums much higher.  The goal is to 
     make trolls better damage sponges while allowing ogres to 
     continue to be brutal melee assailants.
   - Any troll player should see a god to have their HP readjusted.
 
&b&7Humans, half-elves, and orcs have received some stat changes.&0
   - Humans currently are the standard average, with no particular 
     drawbacks.  In order to give them something to stand out, humans 
     now have slightly higher stat caps across the board.
   - Due to centuries of learning to navigate two cultures, half-elves 
     have seen their Charisma cap increased.  They now stand out as 
     the most charismatic of the races.
   - Orcs have long been underpowered.  They've been the equivalent of 
     "evil humans" with less versatility.  Orcs now have some 
     variations in their stats.  They have had their Strength and  
     Constitution increased slightly, while having their Charisma 
     reduced.
   - They also now receive an innate to boost Strength called "chaz".
 
&7&bDwarves and duergar have had their innates changed and their class options broadened.&0
   - Dwarves and duergar have been accepted to the ranks of paladins 
     and anti-paladins respectively.
   - Their previous innate to increase Strength has been swapped out 
     for an innate that increases Wisdom, called "tass".
 
&7&bFinally, gnomes have had some significant changes.&0
   - First, a new innate skill has been created just for them: Create.  
     This skill mimics the spell Minor Creation.  It allows a gnome to 
     create the same list of items using the command:
 
     create <object>
 
     The skill has a cooldown of 75 seconds.
   - An innate called "brill" which boosts Intelligence has been added 
     for gnomes as well.
   - The Charisma cap for gnomes has been increased slightly.
   - The playable classes for gnomes have changed.  Gnomes can now be 
     druids, rogues, and thieves.  They may no longer become 
     diabolists because...
   - A new evil gnome race has emerged from the Underdark!  
     Sverfneblin, also known as deep gnome, is now a playable race!
   - Sverfneblins have the same stats as gnomes, and have access to 
     the brill innate.
   - They do not receive the Create skill.
   - Instead, they gain automatic Sneak in mountain, cave, and 
     underdark environments.
   - Sverfneblins may be the following classes: sorcerer, pyromancer, 
     cryomancer, necromancer, illusionist, cleric, diabolist, rogue, 
     thief, and assassin.
  
&7&bHalflings are still in the pipe for improvements.  New races are being developed now with the aim to release them soon.&0
 
 
&3&bNEW INNATES&0
New innate stat boosts have been created, one for each of the six 
stats. The Strength innate has been renamed, and the other five have 
been given unique names.
 
Charisma - Ascen*
Constitution - Tren*
Dexterity - Syll*
Intelligence - Brill
Strength - Chaz
Wisdom - Tass
(*currently unassigned to a race)
 
   - syntax: innate <name>
 
 
&3&bGEAR OVERHAUL&0
We have undertaken a total overhaul in the stats of weapons and armor.  
It may be the largest player-impacted change Fiery has gone through in a very long time.
 
There were many reasons this was badly needed:
 
&7&bItem strengths were outdated.&0
   - Most of the popular legacy items were built when Fiery stats were 
     on the 18-point scale, not the 100-point scale.  Some of the 
     items we remember fondly from the days of yore only added 1 or 2 
     points to a stat.  They simply weren't as effective when their 
     value was only 1/3 of their intended design.
   - Additionally, many characters start play with key stats of 90+, 
     meaning what had been intended to be the most valuable part of 
     most gear was functionally useless.
   - To address this, items have had their numbers changed across the 
     board.  Some have had their bonuses increased (from +1 to +3, for 
     example), while others have had the types of bonuses expanded 
     (adding additional +1 or +2 bonuses, instead of increasing the 
     original bonus).
 
&7&bFlavor text was often misleading and confusing.&0
   - There was a massive excess of level 1-10 gear with different 
     names/descriptions/flavor text but no functional difference in 
     stats.  New players were finding it prohibitively difficult to 
     understand why so many different items with identical 
     functionality exist.
   - A small handful of items, specifically level 1 daggers, have been 
     removed from the game and replaced with generic daggers.
   - Items with different descriptors now have distinct stats; "a 
     dagger" now has fully different stats from "a steel dagger", for 
     example.
 
&7&bItem levels and capabilities were extremely inconsistent.&0
   - Armor, weapons, and most jewelry now have levels in multiples of 
     5 so some of the guesswork about when an item becomes usable has 
     been simplified.
   - Many objects had vastly different levels but no difference in 
     functionality: a level 15 sword would often have the same stats 
     as a level 1 sword, for example.  It often felt unrewarding to 
     explore a new area and find nothing valuable for your gear setup.  
     It also meant certain pieces of gear were always the best, often 
     for 20-30 levels at a time.
   - Most gear now either reflects the levels of the zone it comes 
     from, both in level and in quality.
   - We've established a general progression for item values based on 
     the type of item, its composition, its level, and any additional 
     effects it might produce.  We used existing items as key points 
     to develop a smoother progression from level 1 to 95.  A higher 
     level item will always have better base qualities than a lower 
     level item of the same type.
   - All two-handed weapons now deal significantly more damage than 
     their one-handed counterparts.
   - Several zone "capstone" items have been massively improved.
 
&7&bMob compositions created a need for new types of damage.&0
   - Some weapons now deal fire, frost, or lightning damage.  NOTE: 
     These items CANNOT be used for specialized attacks like Backstab 
     or Throatcut.
   - These items are VERY FEW and far between.
   - Radiant damage weapons will be coming in the very near future.
 
&7&bGeneral bug fixes.&0
   - Some items have been fixed so they stop decomposing off their 
     wearers. The Creeping Doom quest should be unblocked with this 
     change.
 
 
&3&bNEW SPELLS&0
The Strength spell has been replaced with the more versatile Enhance 
Ability spell, which can be used to increase ANY of the six stats 
(Cha, Con, Dex, Int, Str, Wis).
 
   - syntax: cast 'enhance ability' <target> <stat>
 
 
&3&bSKILL CHANGES&0
&7&bGranted skill levels have been adjusted for many classes.&0
   - They now all unlock at a multiple of 5. Some skill levels have 
     been modified significantly. In particular, skill levels for all 
     rogue-types have been adjusted.
   - Rangers now get the rescue skill.
 
  
&3&bILLUSIONIST FIXES&0
   - Illusionists now get Mass Invisibility at Circle 8.
   - Additional fixes have been made to Simulacrum so your illusions 
     won't try to attack you anymore. (Note: they still deal damage 
     when they shouldn't. We'll fix that at a later date.)

subject: Phase armor gem overhaul notes
message:
The phase armor gem system has long been counter-intuitive and seemingly
random.  Today we release an overhaul of the &7&bnaming system&0 for the gems,
hoping it will make knowing which gems to keep a lot easier.  The &7&bcode&0 for
the quests &2&bhas not changed.&0  It will still function exactly the same.
Our questing system does &7&bNOT&0 use item names to function.
 
The new system uses an even progression of adjectives that should be more
intuitive to follow.
Phase 1 Gems
 - dust -> crushed -> shard
 
Phase 2 gems
 - uncut -> flawed -> <no adjective*>
*for ease of gathering and sorting, these gems now all have the keyword
"plain", but that word will not be included in the gem's visual description.
 
Phase 3 gems
 - perfect -> radiant -> enchanted
 
All classes will consistently use &7&bthe same gem variety&0 across their
class-specific quests.  For example, all clerics (and priests) will use only
amethysts, garnets, and rubies all quests.  Diabolists will use amethyst,
garnet, and ruby for Phase 1, but then carnelian, beryl, and ruby for
Phases 2 and 3.  No other class will use amethyst, garnet, carnelian, or beryl.
 
One important exception: &7&ball body gems will be a ruby, sapphire, diamond,
or emerald.&0  These four varieties of gems will &7&bONLY&0 be used for the body
armor quests.  For example, a perfect, radiant, and enchanted ruby are three
different Phase 3 body gems.  They are not used for any other gear type and
have no difference in value or importance.
 
To make this work, there are now &7&b26 varieties&0 of gems, 14 of which will
&7&bnot appear&0 in Phase 1. 
 
On a technical note, we have been able to do this without changing any of the
back-end code used to run the quests.  Therefore, the quest masters will still
accept gems with the &7&bold names&0 for their respective rewards.
 
There is one exception, as part of the previous quest triggers were incorrectly
written.  The &6&bsorcerer phase 2 head gem&0 should have been
&3&ba handful of amber&0, not &3&ban enchanted amethyst&0.  That has been
corrected in the code, so going forward if any handfuls of amber are floating
around, the quest master will accept them in place of the new gem but will not
accept an enchanted amethyst.
 
We are working to correct every gem currently held by every player.  As that
may take some time, you are welcome to visit Tr'ven in Mielikki and manually
exchange your gems.  You may also exchange them at the Anduin branch of the
Soltan Gem Exchange!  I have also posted the converted names to the player
board.
 
Again I want to stress, with the exception of the sorcerer phase 2 head gem
correction, this change is &7&bpurely visual&0 to increase comprehensibility.
 
If there are any questions, please reach out to me directly!
 
All the best,
Daedela~

subject: Bless/Hex changes
message:
Bless, Earth Blessing, and Dark Presence have had their core functionality
changed.  They will all still continue to modify save vs spell as they always
have, and duration will be determined by skill.
 
At the highest levels, all three spells will now function like Dark Presence 
always has and provide a small bonus to damage.
 
The greatest change is in how these spells alter hitroll.  Previously only
these spells modified hitroll, not items which provided a Bless or Hex effect.
Now, any player under the effect of a Bless or Hex, whether from one of the 
above spells OR from an item with the effect on it, will see a change to their
hitroll.  The amount will depend on their level, rather than the character or 
object which cast the effect.
 
Additionally, the magnitude of the bonus will differ depending on character
alignment and the alignment of the creature being attacked.  Characters will
see a large increase when attacking targets of the opposite alignment, and a
moderate increase against neutral targets.  However, characters will notice a 
moderate DECREASE in their hitroll when attacking targets of the same 
alignment.  Neutral characters will see only a moderate increase against good 
OR evil targets, but suffer no penalty against neutral ones.~

I just wanted to pop in and say hello. Nostalgia. Good memories. Old friends. If you remember me and wish to reach out, you can find me at katkar3636@@gmail.com
Fiery was an important part of my life once upon a time. It's been a couple of decades now. I don't know quite what to say, except that I miss that time and place, and the people who made it feel meaningful. Thank you, to all of you.

I saw the discussion on Fierycon, I was there (it was at my house, in fact).  I am wearing the shirt!  Randomly thought of everyone here and wanted to say "hi"!.  I bet I have a photo somewhere from Fierycon that I can find.
