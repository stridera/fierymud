message:
Ok, the realms have gotten a little richer.

So, this means clans should be able to afford their dues now
so long as they maintain a base of active players to contriubute
to the clan's overall wealth and benefit.

Btw, happy Cinco de Mayo... now where are my dues?!?!

subject: when compared to other muds
message:
I must admit, I've tried a few other muds recently, including Jedimud which was created by Jeremy Elson, the author of circlmud, and I have come to the conclusion that Fiery is one of the best muds out there.

One of the best things about fiery are the room descriptions.  I checked out batmud, which has a religious following of about 400-500 players at any given time, and I didn't even like it.  I couldn't understand the room descriptions.

Another great thing about fiery is the never ending story.  Most of the old players from around here are still learning things about this MUD.  Most muds have a story that just ends with the character winning, which is totally lame.

The purpose of this post is to just thank the gods for doing such a great job, and to point out that those who whine, bicker, complain, etc...really, get a life, or get off the MUD.

message:
I will try to keep this short. Rick (Pergus, of course) was our friend and my mentor for
many years. He was there to hear my heart-song of hardship when no one else seemed to listen.
We confided much in one another about our lives from mudding, relationships, and mysteries
of life. He committed a great deal of his time to us and you helping Fiery stay on its feet
and enjoyed all the fruits of his work, respect, and friendship that it bestowed. He is a
great deal more to me than just a friend as I'm sure he was to most of you, I called him
brother.

Although his life was cut short I know his spirit can never be far from us and those he loved.
He was a good father and husband, a dedicated man to a long forgotten cause and we should all
have a moment of silence and prayer for his soul and family. We keep those we care about in
our memories regardless of the sadness it may bring because this is how they are never forgotten.
Do not forget this man or the care he provided and joy he brought to us all, for as long as
you remember he will always be with us until we meet again in the next stage of life.

Good wishes my brother, you will always be whole-heartedly missed.

message:
1.  Yes, there are several people on this mud who are, without reason, rude beyond all measure.
This unfortunately is a fact of life, and if they suck, don't talk to them.
2.  There are very, VERY few actual new players left on this mud.  This is more a general statement than
a response to the previous post, but it is important for us old players to remember when interacting with
people who are under, oh let's say, level 25.
3.  There's very little friendliness because players are not shown a reason to BE friendly.
Certain people are very, very mean and it perpetuates this problem.  However, you too can help this
situation - when someone tells you something, or especially when someone gives you instruction,
perform this action to the t and do NOT continue to whine.  Whining is the real problem.  I will admit
that EVERYONE in this mud, with one or two very specific exceptions, whines a lot.  A couple people
whine a WHOLE lot though, and this brings me to my actual point - if you are being perceived as
whiny and incompatent, you will be promptly ignored.  This goes for characters of ALL levels, not
just newbies.
4.  Like our dear Lord of Fire used to say, if your character is of an evil alignment, class or race,
this does NOT give you a liscense to be a jerk, talk crap, and treat other people like dirt.  This is
not roleplaying, that's just being a jerk and falsely claiming you have a right to behave as such.
I apologize for letting this get really long, but there are some things here that have needed to be said
for a while now.

ive helped a few people and all they wanted was me to hold there hand and do everything for them.
Ill help when i can but like cerworn pointed out if theres constant whinning ill wont help out. ask once or maybe twice and someone should help out.

Without specific examples, Conchend's advice is not very useful.
I know one kind of newbie activity that brings out the worst in
me is when they ask stuff they should be achieving on their
own. For example, you should not be asking "Where is the Dairy
Farm". You should be finding it.  Same goes for nearly any
area. Fiery's not that big.

On the other hand, if someone needs a CR, it is very bad manners
to taunt them about it and do nothing.  Ignoring newbies who
need CRs is rude too (not helping oldbies is bad form but not
quite so bad).  Of course, if you need help, you DO need to
ask for it.  Just saying "I died" is not enough.

OK guys, I havn't seen a lot of this problem.  Remember, the spirit of this game is to explore, and find things on your own
if you ask for help, My thought is that, you should get a HINT, not a 'go 3 west, and kill the wild boar' -- honestly, I don't see the fun in it, if you just get the instructions, and go do it.  

there are times I've been stuck, and I've had a variety of people off to help me.  I don't think I've ever had anyone turn me away, or ignore me, but I don't constantly ask for help, and I certainly don
't insult the gods, and tell them they have been doing things wrong all along.

I'm also puzzled by some who claim to have been here before, but didn't know certain areas of the game are HIGH LEVEL, and should not bypass the things in place to keep lowbies out.   then complain when they die. I believe things would have gone much easi

subject: Power Level!
message:
I was taken aback by an event that took place Sunday evening.  Brunir achieved his ** status, and exclaimed how proud he was of his accomplishment over 
gossip. When he wasn't immediately congratulated he started prompting praise 
from those of us who were on the mud.  When he finally got the praise he 
desired he then told us of how "difficult" those 2 days and 2 hours were to
master the mud.

I felt it was disgusting that one player had "beaten" the mud in 50 hours, and
expected us to acknowledge his accomplishment with praise.  As if he had 
accomplished something worthwhile.  What was more disturbing is that this seems 
to be the norm on the mud as someone gossiped, 'earning a rank on this mud is 
so rare and so unpopular we don't even discuss it any more.'

I would disagree with Petree who gossiped, 'getting a ** is worthy of gratz, no 
matter how you get it.'   It is my firm belief that true sacrifice and 
accomplishment is worthy of praise, but when you cheat yourself and the system, 
then you have accomplished nothing, and deserve nothing.

So is this the norm?  What are other player's feelings on the topic?  If you 
are a ** and you earned every level through hard work, how would you feel if 
someone was power-leveled and expected the same recognition as you?  How many 
players have a character who was power-leveled?  Do you think any differently 
about power-leveled characters?

In answer to your questions, I despise and abhor pleveling.  I will never understand as long as I live, why people come on a game, and refuse to play it.  What is the fun in that.They will stand around and gossip and drive others crazy trying to get a 
higher level group to take them out for levels.
I rarely get asked anymore.  I have 24 characters (about) and none have been pleveled.  Narak has been thru twice and second time had to solo all
the way.  Course she gets a lot of help from her minions.  They changed
the rules before I remorted, so I set up a deal with Eone that we would go
at the same time so we could group.
I must say that playing with Eone and having to stay within a couple of levels of each other has been great fun, and certainly lots of laughs.
Hardest part is people want to help us, but we cannot accept help from any
one higher then 5 levels above us without losing our prospective prize.
Some have been hard to convince.  Players tend to really be nice and help
each other a lot.
each other a lot.
Enough maundering.  But it is good to have a chance to air my opinion.
Thanks Lolindir, and I still love your name.

message:
well I am Petree's brother, and think my message was taken out of context.reply what I said was anyone who gets **'s is worthy of gratz, even if they 
powerleveled all the way to **, it still took effort, and at least some knowledge
of the mudd.

NOW-- that said, I don't like p-leveling all that much myself, and prefer to do it the hard way.
I really do think that people that get 1 or 2 **'s then use them to p-level 
all their other chars, are losing a lot of how the different characters play
and how the different combinations of characters can be used.
Also, with all the new areas in the mudd, you miss playing them as they were
meant to be played with appropriate level characters.

I have said before, to each his own, and play how you like, so
for those that want to p-level, that's all your choice, but I would encourage . 
everyone to play the game the way it was meant to be played at some point.
if you havn't done it in a while, you should try!
I have a ton of fun with my low-lev chars.  you should too!

I love p-leveling, because i play for my characters and to wear neat stuff.  I
kknow that most people think I'm wrong and gross, but I don't care.  I also
don't think I deserve praise when I get a character to ** because I KNOW I
haven't put in as much work as, say, Suraki did.  If you actually struggle
through each level and gain your stars without any serious assistance, then
that's great!  Good job to you!  But don't expect people to cowtow to you
because you ran through BFT, Nordus, GY or where ever for two days and hit the
last level.  Getting to ** does NOT mean you know much, if anything, about the
game, and doing it over and over doesn't prove anything other than you now
where to find one or more of the zones I just listed.

So enough rant from me, a notorious pleveler.

message:
I have no strong opinions one way or the other about power-levelinga character except for the fact that you are only cheating yourself.
By cheating yourself I do not mean by powerleveling your 3rd rogue
up to ** (as you have played the class through by yourself already)
but rather I mean you lose the experience of actually PLAYING the
game as the character you pleveled in the first place.

I do note that I do not understand logging on, getting ** in 50 hours,
then claiming the game is stupid and pointless and super-easy. As
others have pointed out a few quick jaunts thru BFT, GY, etc can get
your **s in no time.  If you truly explore the land and get a feel for
the rich story and history of the realm then I have no problem if you
plevel yourself to death. (Though what joy people get from only 
typing "kill alligator" over and over I will never understand).  As far
as players like Tavsan go, sure they plevel, but he also has a fairly
rich knowledge of the realm.  If you want to ** yourself before you
risk going to explore, grand, but at ** you will never feel the same
thrill in Lava as someone in their 30s.

Of course, I suppose this is the reason the imms put hour 
requirements on some of their quests and the reason they ask
various forms of trivia and "go collect this" kind of quests which
involve the far-flung sections of the realm.  I really do feel badly
for people who are so "accomplished" at their ** but even once 
there do not realize that they are missing the whole game while
they get there.

And not to pick on the ** rogues out there, but, well, there are SO
many cooler classes and even subclasses to rogue!

i have cheated and weasels my whole way up to the top.by top i mean by no means that my chars are spectacular, but

for something, and fighters should know were there eq comes
from more than anyone else, because eq makes the difference
between good and crappy players(and of course, the knowledge/
skill behind it).
i definetly agree, that i have missed out on 70% of the mud.
because i didnt take the time to enjoy the ingame quests and such
ive had alot of fun with my little monk, because dispite my 
best efforts hes still a lowbee, and its still tuff for him.
i played him up to 20 or more without assisting with any other chars of mine
before i lost will power. he still does lots on his own. my plvling
is not usualy to get someone to **. its just to move things along, so i dont have to kill
smugglers for weeks. 
im deffinetly a fan of occational minor plvling, and such, but keep

hey all. well i cant honestly say i didnt plevel here and there. i did it to a certain level then solo'd the char.as for brunir to get ** well good for him clearing out nordus all time. that deserves such big praise to do that. theres moe to this game then pleveling.
if i plevel a char i try some whacky/insane stuff bourderline suicidal stuff sometimes for kicks and to kill bordem here and there.
ill have to say everyone is so into going to noruds and bf all the time to plevel chars. theres more to the game then that.
you would know theres better areas to level then there if u explore, and its fun to find stuff out on a area on your own.
erm gives me crap when i dont tell him something he should know, calling me rude, but when he's asking for help he cries cause noone gives him any.
if your ** u should know alot about the game. theres still lots of stuff i need to learn ill admit that, but i know just enough to get around good.
for suraki and others that play the game like the gods want to they do deserve big praise and rewards to do that. more people need to do that.
if u cant do that well play something else. if u do it once u can do it again. look at cylor when he remorted. took him about a mounth.
thats what happens when u know the game good.

message:
Clearly there is need of the name rules to be written somewhere more evident
than that which are already written on the character creation screen.  So here
are all the reasons why we may choose to delete you because of your name.

Your name may not contain any of the following.

1. Compound words. Examples: LadyJade, BraveBlade, ImmortalSoul
 These types of names give a player an unearned arrogance above
 other players and in some instances above the gods.
2. Offensive words or names, mispelled or backwards. Eg: Sgurd Kcuf Emod
3. Names from known mythos, movies etc... Examples: Feyd, Conan, Zeus
 Come on, you can be more creative than reliance on an existing known
 character.
4. Names that do not fit the character you are playing. Examples:
 A human named Gruzel
 A troll named Bob
 A boy named Sue
 An orc named Ripenthiel
5. No offensive words or names from other languages or cultures.
6. No Nouns verbs or adverbs. Eg. Jester, Red, Dog, Bloody, Hotly, Freedom
 Pervert, PC, Trouble, McIntosh, Desperado.  Sorry guys LAME.
7. No names that resemble common nouns verbs or adverbs. Eg. Jesterx,
 Redx, Chamelion, Desperato etc...
8. No modern names. Examples: Rina John Mike Steve
No one.

We may choose to ask violators to change their names. This decision will be on an
invidiviual basis and may or may not seem fair. Some people have gotten away with
silly names, and that's all fine and dandy. But yeah...anywho, I ramble. :P

your issue, so it is crucial that the room be the one with the problem.

Step 2:
When reporting bugs/typos, try to be as detailed as you can with what
the actual problem is.  Saying something like "this mob has a bad description"
doesn't exactly help us know what you mean.  Sure we can figure it out
eventually, but the longer we take to figure it out, the less likely it is
that it will be fixed.

Step 3:
DON'T WASTE OUR TIME WITH SPAM!  We will delete/purge/freeze or feed you to
dragons.  Well, maybe not that severe, but seriously.  Don't tell us hi on
bug/typo/idea.  Don't tell us we're doing a horrible job.  Don't tell us that
we have smelly feet!  Don't tell us we should get bent, or dunk our heads in
ice water.  It's all very much a waste of our time, and smothers the real
issues in spam.  So please, refrain from unnecessary messages.

In addition to those, players should know which category to pick when
reporting their issue.  Bug/typo/idea.  They are ALL different, and need to be
treated as such.

Bug:
Anything that has to do with the programming code, or scripting language.  
The scripting language is what is used to run our quests, so if the quest is
obviously broken, then that's a bug.  If an emote is giving weird messages,
that's a programming bug.  If a door is not working properly, that is also a
bug, but only a very slight one.  But still use bug.  

Typo:
Use this issue report function when you want to report a grammatical or
spelling error in a description, or quest speech, or whatever.  If it's
spelled wrong, or put in the wrong part of a sentance, use this to report it.
Just be sure to tell us exactly where the typo is so that we know where to
look.  If you had a hard time finding that typo, chances are we're going to
have the same hard time if not harder.  So be precice.  

Idea:
This is where you report your ideas that we will most likely end up
ignoring.  This is not because your ideas are horrible, terrible, stupid,
etc...  No, we'll probably not implement your ideas because we're lazy, and
are working on more important things.  It should come as no shock to anyone
that 99% of the ideas submitted are thrown out immediately due to being...  
Well...  Stupid.  The remaining 1% that are deemed to have any merit are
usually ignored for a year before someone works on them.  So with that in
mind, please please please please PLEASE try to make your ideas good!  If you
think for one second that your idea won't ever be considered because it sounds
stupid to you, then do us all a favor.  DON'T SUBMIT IT!  For instance...  If
something has been removed from the game, chances are we're not bringing it
back.  Like the area "Dark Abbey".  That zone is removed until someone goes in
and fixes it all up and makes it pretty and balanced.  Until then, DON'T ask
us to bring it back.  It's not going to happen.  Same goes for permastone
enhanced objects.  Not happening.  Vaporform...  NOT HAPPENING!  If you would
like us to discuss your idea with you, then submit it on the forums.  It would
be alot easier for us to tell you why we're not going to accept your idea
there.  Or maybe flesh out that idea a little.


Please keep in mind that there are very few active deities, and as such, our
workload is, to say the VERY least, immense.  With that in mind, take the long
paragraphs above with a grain of salt, and understand that we are not getting
paid for this.  Well...  Maybe Zzur is...  But the rest of us aren't.  :P

If you get nothing else out of this post, at least get this.  Don't spam us
with your nonsense!  But don't be scared away from submitting real issues that
need to be fixed.  Most of them are genuine, but please don't drown those out
in nonsense.  In this case, try to have a little empathy with the gods.  We
are, after all, trying to make this game a better and more interesting place.
Don't demoralize us with wasted time.

subject: Re: Venath wrt bug/idea/typo etiquette
message:
While I must agree that some idea/bug submissions are obnoxious (such as "bob
is so nice", "green", and "does this give you laryngitis?"), I would say that
the vast majority of them are quite legitimate.
 
We do pay attention to each bug and idea submitted, and very few get thrown
away.  When we do reject an idea, it is usually because either it would be
terribly difficult for us to implement or we think it would unnecessarily
disrupt what balance we have in the game.
 
I will admit that we coders frequently do not have enough time to do all the
things we would like to.  We each have our own pet projects, and time
available for coding must get divided between working on our own ideas,
implementing player ideas, and fixing bugs.  Sometimes bugs and ideas are
easy to resolve, and other times they take an eternity (for instance, I've been
working on a fix for the crash bug with clans for the last two days).
 
I guess I'm asking for patience when it comes to bugs and ideas; don't
let us slack off though.  Please don't submit duplicate reports, but
feel free to remind us if you feel that an issue is going unaddressed.
Don't be afraid to submit any serious ideas, either!

should the prize for first to lvl 1 mean first to gain a lvl? that should put you to 2. just wanted to clarify.
also, when set to lvl 98, will money be part of the standard eq? also, are we to keep the new characters? after being set to lvl 98?
likely the characters will often have to be considered on a case by case basis. for instance i may want to
use my lvl 75 monk for both competitions.
3rd question: evil races are disqualified, right?

1) You're right; it should be level 2.  I'll fix that.
2) I could throw in a small amount of money in the starting
   equipment for the endgame challenge.
3) No; unfortunately you won't be able to keep the new
   characters after being set to level 98.  As stated,
   you won't be able to use currently existing chars--
   only brand-new chars or newbie chars used in the
   newbie challenge.
4) Yes, to maintain fairness all new characters used in
   the quest will have to be one of the six standard races.
-Lao

PS: However, you will of course be able to keep the characters
you create in the first (regular) challenge--just not the ones
from the third (endgame) challenge.

A month or so ago I sent an email to Kourrya (at Zzur's request)
asking her to come for a visit as we needed her and her expertise.
At that time she replied, it was not possible cause she was just
leaving on a trip to japan for a couple of weeks, She might get back
to us later.
Last week I sent her another email telling her that her 2 weeks were 
up and school was about to start.
She replied thusly:-
Yes, college just started here.

Unfortunately, since I graduated last semester, I can no longer keep my student job and am entering the frighteningly difficult real world job market. Wish me luck....

I then replied to this email saying I would pray for her, and that
I would let everyone else know.
So there you have it

Do me a favor and CLOSE zmud, or gmud, or whatever mud client you use when you
are not playing.  Several of you stop playing for long periods of time and
your characters continuously login and sit at the menu screen until you are
idle too long and then get disconnected....  And zmud automagically logs you
back in, you sit at the menu screen, and then you get disconnected.  This is
not good for the mud, or my eyes, as everytime you connect, it spams me, as
well as when you disconnect.  So before you make me angry, please stop doing
this.

message:
Greetings
Due to someone's low level character being rude to my druid
who sends wells on demand, I have changed her trigger.
If you are full up and she is on, and you need a well you
need only trigger her and she will send you one.
The new trigger is:-
If I am on, ask me and I will tell you. If I am not on, mudmail Suraki
and she will return your mudmail with the new trigger.
I am sorry if this has inconvenienced you, and I am certain that it was
strictly role play on their part, but two can play at that game, and I do
not encourage rudeness on gossip ever.
If anyone else asks you for the trigger, please refer them to Suraki.
Thanks,

i really dont think its much of roleplaying, some people just expect to have things handing out to them.
and some people dont want to learn anything bout the game but thats another subject.
EVERYONE should be greatful for getting a well to town, cuts down on walking time, and gives more time to 
slaughter innocent civilians.
