To command the shards of ice in battle, we have finally
reached the stage where you must prove your mastery of
ice itself.  13 creatures of ice stand in your way, so
it will be necessary to defeat them.  As well, bring 14
items made of ice to show your craftsmanship skill.
 
It is of course not as simple as that, for ice takes many
forms.  Bring 4 items of snow as well, to command the ice
present in the deepest winter.  And what master of frozen
skills would be complete without mastering the storms that
bring ice and snow to the world?  I will need 3 storm items
and proof of the defeat of 4 storm creatures before you
will have proved yourself.
 
Finally, to show that you can master the formation of shards,
bring me a "shard" that is not a gem, and "shards" that can
be worn.
 
One last bit of trivia and we are done.  Using the knowledge
gained by studying sorcery, for you must be well suited to
research after all this time, bring me the answer to a single
question: Why is Black Lake black?
 
Once completed, you will be awarded with your most powerful
spell.  Good luck!

So you wish to have some people banished?  You will need to follow the
proper procedures, of course.  Please formulate your request on five
pieces of PARCHMENT and three LETTERs and find two WAX items to seal the
letters.  Stamp them with an INSIGNIA and address them to the eight KINGs.
 
But before you write your requests, I suggest that you research
banishment in depth by getting some perspective from some banished ones.
Locate two with HALF-ELVEN in their name, two DUERGAR, two OGREs, and
two OUTCASTs.  You may dispose of them when their usefulness is expired.
Also find three items that are HALF what they could be.
 
With that research, I am sure your request will be granted and that your
enemies will be banished.  But is not over yet.  You will need to keep
the banished out.  To this end, bring twenty STONE items to build a mighty
wall to keep the banished ones out forever.
 
Looking forward to the banishing,

Dear Altus:
 
The spell "Group Heal" is a useful tool, and to prove your worth
you must do a few things for me.  The first would be to study under
those of your order who know the importance of grouping.  Please seek
out the high fire priest, the high stone priest, Sorcha, the dark 
patriarch, and Ruin Wormheart.  When you have studied their techniques,
eliminate those leaders and at least 1.00 of their minions.
 
Next I shall need you to prove your skill in healing.  To this end,
bring me five healing potions that cast something better than "cure light"
(they need not respond to "potion") and two items that respond to
HEALING.
 
Accomplish these tasks and the spell "Group Heal" is yours!

message:
Greetings, my dark pupil Norath:  
It has come to my attention that you still lack your most
powerful spell. To remedy this situation, I shall grant
you a quest for the spell Shift Corpse.
 
The power to shift the corpses of friends (and enemies,
as the case may be) is not an easy task by any means.
It will require extensive knowledge of the corpse. No doubt
you have acquired such knowledge in your chosen profession
of Necromancer, but we should like to see such knowledge
demonstrated in a more practical form, so please bring
me a "hand", a "paw", four "breast"s, a "chest", five
"heart"s, two "stomach"s, eight "head"s, five "eye"s,
eight "leg"s, two "limb"s, both a "foot" and a "feet", and one "ear". 
 
I will also require a "precious" item with which to
decorate the corpse. 
 
Finally, to prove your mastery, destroy 5 "spirit"s,
two "body"s, three "head"s, an "arm", and a "hand". 
 
Good luck in your quest!

Consultation with the dark fires of hellReveal healing is not your strongest spell
Thus in order for you to acquire
There are many things I shall require
First, learn to bind CLOTH upon a wound
You will need 13 to become attuned
But if the patient's pain will not fade
Contrary to common sense, it must be allayed
You will need 13 different HERBs for soothing
Second, learn to set BONEs within a sling
Practice upon 13 different of these
Five of which must definately be keys
Then to keep the patient calm and not frisky

message:
Sweet Jasta,
We faeries have heard your prayer and will grant you a great boon if 
you undertake a path through the Dreamlands and into the very soul 
of the world.
A journey such as this is very dangerous, so in order to prepare, 
find a sight that when beheld your mind fills with thoughts of 
ancient priests and battles.  Arrive at this location with the 
following to begin the ritual to revive the dead.

As you seek the power to return life, seek out a life stolen that 
may be returned.  Bring with it the essence of life, the crimson 
beauty that sets the foretelling morning sky ablaze.  Study THRICE 
the forces of DEATH from differing parts of the land, and 
THRICE the will of the LIVING, so that you might get a glimpse at 
the miracle you wish to perform.  Study the THREE CORPSEs, never 
decaying, that you may see how to reverse the deaths and restore the 
bodies.  Bring with you one foci from each body.

With this knowledge, construct a circle using THREE each of the four 
elements.  Bring ROCKs to be the Earth, one of which must be used to 
complete a planar gate elsewhere in the realm.  LIGHTNING for Air, 
of which be sure to find a completed circle.  True WATER for Water, 
though one must be formidable enough to protect you from spirits that 
might try to revive themselves through your workings.  FIRE for Fire, 
at least one of which must be the true essence of the word.

To find the mystic power that fuels the glory of the Resurrection, 
you must look within the source of dreams, the Reverie.  Fill your 
mind with the transcendent aroma of SIX MUSHROOMs and NINE HERBs, 
burned in FOUR BOWLs.  Release their powers with SMOKING, SMOLDERING, 
and THREE BURNING objects.  Contemplate your three foci and they will 
draw you into the beautiful land of the Dreaming.  
Within the Reverie, you shall receive visions of walking CORPSEs 
numbering THREE, and haunted GHOSTs numbering THREE BY THREE.  Be 
warned, for visions here are as real and as dangerous as those 
experienced in the waking world!  Channel their powers into a DIAMOND 
worth at least 5000 GP, which shall forever be your connection to the 
world of the spirits.

To the Prince of Dark Ways, Saka,The Unseelie courts have heard your plee and will grant your powerful 
request.  However, the power to resurrect the dead does not come 
cheaply.  A visit to the Reverie at the heart of the Dreamlands will 
be required to harness this miraculous spell. 

First, you will have to free a stolen soul to guide you.  He has long 
known the true horror of death.  Second, you must revive him with 
BLOOD, retrieved from a place of utter desecration.  You as well must 
experience first-hand the forces that you seek to command, so your 
guide may speak to you as a kindred.  Find THRICE DEATH, each in a 
different corner of the realms, and THRICE the strong will of the 
LIVING.  Once you have grappled with their powerful intents, you 
shall be ready to being your voyage into the heart of nightmares.

With this knowledge in your heart, construct a circle using THREE each 
of the four elements.  Bring ROCKs to be the Earth, one of which must 
be used to complete a planar gate elsewhere in the realm.  LIGHTNING 
for Air, of which be sure to find a completed circle.  True WATER for 
Water, though one must be formidable enough to protect you from 
spirits that might try to revive themselves through your workings.  
FIRE for Fire, at least one of which must be the true essence of the 
word.

In order to be granted your power, you must prove that you are 
dedicated to the forces of Chaos, for resurrection is nothing short of 
perverting the natural flow of life and death, throwing the heavens 
into tumultuous disarray!  Writing binds the world together in a 
coherent, provable fashion.  In such a method, the vast powers of the 
Fae are limited and restrained.  To unleash our true potential, 
recover NINE books and burn them in the ritual flames.  Bring with you 
SIX ETHEREAL forces to protect your very soul from being torn asunder, 
and then release the powers of THREE sources of CHAOS.  In doing so, 
you will be taken fully into the Reverie and shown a vision of your 
own great ancestors . THREE DEMON LORDS.
Perform to each Lord a sacrifice of THREE: SWIRLING sacrifices to one 
who watches the same, BLOOD sacrifices to one who drinks endlessly, 
and WAR sacrifices to one entrenched in an eternal battlefield.  As 
proof of your love, give to each a different corrupted, fallen or evil 
SYMBOL as well.  Once you have placated them, find the correct focus 
so that .You feel something within you mend, and a power from beyond 
merging with your own..  This will be the granting of their powers.  
Then, return to the waking world with either their memories or proof 
of your visit.

Finally, your focus for the casting of this spell must be a DIAMOND, 
worth no less than 5000 GP.  Be sure to bring such a thing with you 
before you enter into the Dreaming, or else your trip will be wasted 
and your power lost.

message:
Greetings, my dark pupil Bleck:

It has come to my attention that you still lack your most
powerful spell. To remedy this situation, I shall grant
you a quest for the spell Shift Corpse.

The power to shift the corpses of friends (and enemies,
as the case may be) is not an easy task by any means.
It will require extensive knowledge of the corpse. No doubt
you have acquired such knowledge in your chosen profession
of Necromancer, but we should like to see such knowledge
demonstrated in a more practical form, so please bring
me two "hand"s, a "paw", four "breast"s, a "chest", five
"heart"s, two "stomach"s, thirteen "head"s, five "eye"s,
nine "leg"s, two "limb"s, both a "foot" and a "feet",
and two "ear"s.

I will also require a "precious" item with which to
decorate the corpse.

Finally, to prove your mastery, destroy 5 "spirit"s,
two "body"s, five "head"s, an "arm", and a "hand".

Good luck in your quest!

The next spell you must learn is group armor.  Protecting your
allies with such magical armor can grueling and thankless, but
perseverance will bring great rewards.  To be properly prepared,
however, you will need to gather 5 items of ARMOR, 2 items of
PROTECTION, and 1 item that casts 'armor' on the whole room.  To
complete your task, kill eighteen immobile mobs that appear in
groups of three or more.  Each mob must be from a different zone.
(So for instance, seethers would not count, even if you walked
into a room with 3 of them, but a mob such as the Elite Lizard Man
would count.)

message:
To Elder Mosiah, Guardian of Truth,
 
Your request for the power over death comes at a price--reversal
of such a...life-changing event, removing such a degree of chaos
from the universe, requires returning an equal amount of chaos to
the world.
 
First, you must release a demon lord, long ago summoned to this
realm for dark enterprises.  To accompany this deed, find three
items of CHAOS incarnate, one FLAMING item, and six LANTERNs to
complete the preparation.
 
Next, capture a memento of a SOUL to overcome DEATH five times.
Try to rejoin this soul with each of the four CORPSEs.  Of course
this will fail (who do you think you are, a necromancer?), but
it will prepare you for the next step: the thrice sacrifice of
the LIVING.
 
In the final dedication, you must gather eleven things of PURPLE
and of two BLOODY carnage.  Circle these items around the ritual
flames, atop which you must envelop the corpses of eight MASTERs
of trade.  In these fires, destroy five RODs, five HOT items, and
one MAPLE.  With this complete, you will gain the requisite power
to raise your comrades from death.

To Kiram, Student of Sorcery:
 
Greetings and good fortune to you in your travels.
 
To summon the forces of the heavens in calling down a swarm of
meteors is a very dangerous prospect. It is essential, therefore,
to be able to controll these forces lest they turn upon you.
 
Numbers being very important to rituals, I will need you to
conduct a proper countdown before the summoning can be completed.
As such, I will need:
 
7 ROCKs, for that is what a meteor is
6 CHUNKs to give it shape
5 SUNs, for they are found in the heavens as well
4 FIERY creatures, to give it force
3 STORM items to sway it
2 TAILs to guide it
1 EARTH creature, for that is the sphere of the spell
 
And last, kill a creature of BLACK ENERGY to seal the deal.
 
Report back to me when this is complete.

Copied from Aurius' original Resurrection quest from Pergus.

Resurrection is a delicate thing, requiring mastery of both life and
death. To unlock her secrets, you will need to find me a few items
such as:
 
A "shank" of BONE and death's "disguise" to start, love's "token" of
the one who cries, and a HEART that never dies.
 
One embued with "essessence wrongly taken," and the might of he who
would "bridge the gap between this world and the next," combined with
the volume of "saving grace" for me.
 
Lastly but not least, a SPECKLED "paradox" as offering and the RARE
"pear", to ensure we are not vexed.
 
Be sure to bring a VEST that isn't a "gloomy" thing.
 
Along the way, you'll need to greet five different ANCIENTs, four
STALKERs, and three HIGH PRIESTs, two GHOULs, and one SUCCUBUS ... for
research of course. And by greet I do mean the end of a blunt object

message:
Coyo, Dwarven Priest:
 
As you know, Dragon's Health is an extremely powerful and difficult spell.  As
such, the test for it will also be extremely difficult. Therefore, we will
require certain aspects of both "dragons" and "health".
 
For dragons, be certain to bring us 11 dragon body parts. Look carefully; many
items which respond to "dragon" are not actually parts of dragons!
 
The "health" is trickier. To begin with, we will need 65 items that give a
positive bonus to your hitpoints. Keep in mind, the higher level armor quest
items should NOT be used for this! Such items will not be accepted - though
feel free to use the lowest level ones.
 
To merge them into one, we require 2 "wax", 1 "beeswax", one "sticky", and 5
"rope" items. I will also need some glue, so be sure to have at least 1.00 each
of 11 different horses.
 
In addition, to bear the burden of strain, you will need to bring 6 mountable
creatures to the fountain - but no horses, as you will surely have obtained
their enmity.
 
Finally, as the spell's usefulness increases with its duration, please bring to
us an item which has the inscription "Tyme shalt only make myne love for thee
stronger." To represent the danger you face, bring an item that "Kings and
queens have sent explorers to their deaths for". For opposition, bring an
object that casts "life drain". To represent the strain of casting, bring an
item that looking at it too long "gives you a headache".
 
Be sure that the spell does not fall into the wrong hands; bring an item that
is said to ward off vampires.
 
Good luck!
Laoris, the Invisible One (and Kourrya, Mistress of Shadows)

Your humble petition was a welcome reprieve
From the endless demands of those more naive.
Yet my station requires me to be just
So for your request a real challenge is a must.
 
To cast the storms of a celestial event
You must contest the bodies of the sky's extent
Confront the ASTRAL and five CELESTIALs,
Then two GODDESSes and four ANGELs for your trials.
 
Traverse the night skies and collect from them three STARs,
And then gather thirty lights from here to Mars.
Some may be unwilling without brutal fights,
So show you mean business: slay two SUNs and three LIGHTs.

One last bit of trivia and we are done.  Using the knowledge

In order to be granted access to the fires of hell for destructive

To this effect, prepare 7 CIRCLEs with 7 FIRE items.  Then fill them

SACRIFICIAL item.  Hold up an unholy SYMBOL in each hand to invoke
the powers of darkness.
 
Once you have completed this ritual, it will be time to prove your

an ANGEL of darkness, and one of a holy order who has lost his grace.

Greetings my dark pupil Norath
It has come to my attention that you still lack your most powerful spell. To remedy this situation, I shall grant you a quest for the spell Shift Corpse.
It will require extensive knowledge of the body, so please bring me a "hand", a "paw", four "breast"s, a "chest", five "heart"s, two "stomach"s, eight "head"s, five "eye"s, eight "leg"s, both a "foot" and a "feet", and one "ear".
In addition, to show the value of the spell, I will require you to bring me 13 objects of different colors and 4 of "rainbow" hue. Note for the purposes of this that a different name for a color is a different color; hence, "crimson" and "red" would count
Finally, to prove your mastery, destroy 5 "spirit"s, two "body"s, three "head"s, an "arm", and a "hand".
Good luck in your quest!
