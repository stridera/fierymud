message:

INFO - 
1) Name of the Guild      (Please be reasonable, no silly names)
2) Type of Guild.         (Clan, or Guild)
3) Leader name            (Player name)
4) Four initial members.  (One Sub-Leader, three officers)
5) Alignment restrictions (Limited to evil/good,race/align?  State it if so.)
6) Guild Description      (Who you are, where you came from.)
7) Time Requirements      (State online time requirements for members)
8) Membership Fees        (State fees for assoc members, if any)
COSTS - 
The initial start up cost for guilds is 1000 plat for now, but as the player
base expands and we balance things like exp and money these costs will go up.
Each real life month, the guild will pay 10 platinum per member in tax. 
Titles, new members, etc, are all free and handled by the guild leaders.  
It will be up to the guild leader to make sure the taxes are paid!
If the taxes are not paid within 30 real life days, the guild will be
removed. 
3.) MAINTENANCE
After the association is created, it is up to the Leader and founding
members to handle nearly all of the various maintenance tasks.  Adding,
removing, titling, and ranking of members are all automatic via the 'clan'
command. There are many commands available to
the clan members, leaders, and officers, and all should
familiarize themselves with the helpfiles to learn them.
Each guild has it's own built-in bank account as well, accessed by
the 'clan' commands.  All members may deposit money into the Assoc's
coffers, but only the leader may withdraw said money.  Read the helpfiles
for more information.
Guildhalls...  There is no need to purchase one at the time of creation, 
but once the association is official,
the assoc leader may build a guildhall at any time, simply by petitioning
an builder to create the initial room on-line in a mutually agreed
upon location.  Once that is done, all descriptions, rooms, and modifications
will cost some cash..
Notes - 
ORGANIZATION :  A guild can be composed of any combination of members
that follow standard grouping restrictions on the MUD.  
(eg, no paladins;with evil aligns, no good races with evil races, etc.)
Guilds are limited to a maximum of 20 members.  The minimum;level for 
joining a guild is level 20. RP can be lot of fun and will add
a unique character.  In addition, please refrain from silly,
frivolous, vulgar, or rude titles.  We will be watching and we have no
desire to intervene in anything.

These things have to be earned through something special.
Just because a player wants the title GodSlayer he's not
getting it. So if a player requests something special they
better have done something pretty damn awsome to get it.

Many of the things I do associated with FieryMUD are also applicable to
my work environment, whether it's unix system admin tasks I must learn
to preform, or shell scripting, coding, webbing, backups, it's all extra
skill in integrating not only my talents but the talents of some very
gifted people world wide.  You people may not realize this but you are
gaining valuable exp (you may even level one day) working with this as
a 'hobby'.  Sure, doing whack ass apache groups and encryption may be
way over kill, but it sounds really really cool, I think that knowledge
would be good to have even if I never use it again.  I can at least tell
someone this is what apache does versus netscape or whatever bastard MS
has produced this week etc etc...
I say we give it a go :) woo hoo.  Let's call a meeting to make it a
true Dilbert environ, wonder if my hair is pointy...

message:
Backups happen every night at some time from midnight to 1am.
Player files consist of multiple files.
The player file.
The object file
the quest file
and the notes file

If you need a restore I need to know what day and time the 
problem happened and which of the files need to be restored.
Typically it's just the object file, as that's all that's 
ever missing.

   Everyone who participated got the box, the rose, and the two chocolates.  
Special prizes were awarded to Drac (1 for MVP award, one for first place),
Karde, and Sata.  Drac got obj 2290, a jet black shank, and...  Umm, some ring,
what was it again Acerite?  Karde gets a Death Shroud, obj 2288, and Sata I
believe was awarded some extra hp.  (Tsan and Puzo if you think you deserve
prizes that's not up to me *cough* since you were not around for the awards
ceremony.  )

yeah karde gets a death shourd, sata got about 120 extra hp base
(meaning it's not from an item)umm...mouvar got tanle's ring of
pride or something. (feel free to change that if you want)
and the basic participation price was the box and rose etc..which
function as a lockable sack and quill.

whole point of all those isn't that they're overly great (except
maybe for the ring) but they are very unique.

Just a heads up too not let players get the whole damn story. I think
