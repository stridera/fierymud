As you look at the tapestry, your spirit rises from the sublime 
colors and expert weaving of the piece, then falls, as you notice how 
ragged its edges are, and how obviously neglected it is. There's no way 
it can be repaired, you see. That's too bad. If it were in better shape, 
it'd be worthy of a lord's castle. You might even want to put it in 
yours, if you ever get one.

This is a pair of fine goggles, made of expertly tanned leather and lenses of
thick glass.  Excellent for protecting the eyes from the loose dust and
occasional hazards in a mine, they would probably also be useful outdoors in a
sandstorm, though underwater use would probably ruin the leather and is not
recommended.
