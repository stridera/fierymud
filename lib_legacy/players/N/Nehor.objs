extradesc: hood-assassin invisible-hood
Made out of pure shadow, a hood like this allows the wearer to do more than
hide; they gain the senses of the shadows themselves.  Prized by rogues and
assassins alike, a hood like this is rarely found, but given to a person who
has advanced to the highest ranks in their guild.~
