Smoky quartz is a powerful mystic matrix because it energizes like clear quartz
but also has strong connections to the realms of sleep and dreams.  Set in
silver, a ring like this provides powerful connections to both the moon and the
Reverie, making it highly prized by faeries and witches alike.~

silver teardrop is encircled with a thin copper wire and anchored to black
leather cord.  The tear is frigid to the touch and fills your mind with an

The staff has intricate elven runes across its length, telling of histories
long ago past.  Finely chiseled from a heavy dark brown maple wood, it has a
carved handle two-thirds of the way up so it may be held without covering any
of the runes.    ~

The thin staff is as light as a hollowed out tube, but as strong as any metal
sword picked off the forge.  The green glow radiating from the brown oak gives
the impression that the stick is naturally green.  The glow seems to emanate a
deep wisdom.    ~

It's a long wingfeather from the bright birds that live around Morgan Hill.  
It looks ideal for scribing spells into a spellbook.~

Looking rather tattered, this long tailfeather is too beat-up to look good in a
hat.  It seems sturdy enough to use as a pen, though.~
