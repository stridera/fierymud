Heavily enchanted cloth has been woven together to create these magical
slippers.  Pieces of clothing like this focus mystical energies, making them
easier to manipulate.  Most sorcerers find clothing like this can strengthen
almost any arcane workings.

extradesc: orb
   The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow. Gazing 
into its crystalline depths, there seems to be insubstantial forms 
floating within it. Before you can decide what lies within, you are 
forced to look away, lest its light blinds you.

  The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand. It seems to light up
the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

This little stone flask is a perfect sculpture of a stony golem, save the
little stopper protruding from the top of its head.  Its hollow stone eyes
chillingly reflect no emotions or remorse...  Though that would seem to be
normal from such an inanimate object as this.

About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.

Grotesque and ugly, the severed goat's head oozes blood from its neck just
below the jawbone.  Its whitish hair is stained and matted, clumping and
sticking in knots.  A limp pinkish tongue droops out of its mouth between rows
of vicious-looking teeth, forming a puddle of horrid-smelling drool beneath it.
