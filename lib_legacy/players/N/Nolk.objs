These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.

This backpack is able to contain a large selection of goods, but its bulky
size makes it quite heavy. It is crafted from a fine waterproof leather,
and seems capable of resisting most adverse weather conditions.

extradesc: rapier sword ornate bright
This slender rapier is long, its blade not sharp but is point wickedly so.
It is made of some very bright alloy of steel that looks almost silvery,
and its hilt is wrapped in blue leather. The crossguard is the traditional
basket hilt, but very ornately done, sweeping and scrolling.
