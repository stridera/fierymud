The coral ring seems totally flawless.  It is made of the finest coral you have
ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white on the other.  It
is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance so that it is not the
least bit abrasive.~

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

This looks like the cap of a rather large mushroom.  It's big enough to cover
the top of a human's head!  It is dried, and the consistency of stiff leather.
It's a pale orange color, with barely visible white spots.~

This is a very interesting and intricate necklace.  It is made of an
intricately braided green material and a has a large crocodile tooth at the
very center.  It must have taken many hours to make this amazing necklace.~

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

The torch is simple in its design. It's made up of a piece of wood with
some cloth wrapped around the top of it, and smells like it has been
dipped in oil.~

will know what to do with it.~

The coral ring seems totally flawless.  It is made of the finest coral you have
ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white on the other.  It
is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance so that it is not the
least bit abrasive.~
