This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.

These boots are made from hardened leather, dyed black and covered with steel
studs.  Eerily not a creak or a whisper comes from these boots, which makes them
perfect for sneaking while armored.  In addition, they are very light, which
keeps them from impeding movement.  A pair of boots like this would be a
perfect gift for anyone who valued stealth and quickness.

This 'scrap' of leather is actually a perfect rectangle and has nicely finished
edges and small, nearly invisible cords hanging from two sides.  In addition,
it seems to be reinforced with bands of padding, making it comfortable to wear.
It could easily be tied to the forearm, and would probably blend in well with
the darkness.

green gelatin caked on it.  The goo is quite sticky, causing anything touching

This is no ordinary book, this is the book of healing that for centuries has
kept Nordus free of plagues and serious illnesses.  The whole book is magical,
and there are records of how its power prevented the village of Nordus being
overcome by plagues on several occasions.

extradesc: foot lucky-rabbits-foot lucky-rabbit-foot
Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.

extradesc: memento lover's lovers lovers-soul soul locket platinum
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    
~

It reads,
"My thought will be for you
My love will be in you
You are the one to love me
So I will live forever"

dagger is a little longer than a human hand, reaching just far enough from the
wrist to do some serious damage.

The tube is stiff so its contents will not get folded or torn. The tube
has an opening at one end, perhaps you should glance inside?

It is hard to discern the edges of this tunic, for they fade and shift from
sight, as if actively avoiding detection.  While apparently made from
black, studded leather, the tunic is lighter than most cloth and can be violently
shaken without making a sound.  Tunics of this kind are often presented to
high-ranking rogue guild members and are not given away lightly.

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.

Garlic is said to be able to ward off vampires.  It certainly will ward off
your friends if you eat too much of it, as it can cause very bad breath.  It
is, however, excellent at curing minor illnesses such as the common cold.

Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.

this spice, so it has something of a nasty reputation.

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.

Garlic is said to be able to ward off vampires.  It certainly will ward off
your friends if you eat too much of it, as it can cause very bad breath.  It
is, however, excellent at curing minor illnesses such as the common cold.

It's a bit of meat from the elusive polar trout.  Fry it up with dill or mince
it into pies for the best flavor.  It's said that te natives of Odaishyozen eat
raw fish with rice, but it would probably taste better cooked.

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.
