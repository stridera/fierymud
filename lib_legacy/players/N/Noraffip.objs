A shiny disc of polished steel makes the main part of this piece of armor.
Tooled across its edges with a scrolling design, everything about it, from
the subtle decorations to the fine straps, makes it look expensive and
highly effective. There are only a few little dents in its surface to mar
its mirror-like perfection.
