This ball of light is the most mysterious and magical things you have ever
seen.  The ball is very bright but yet dark at the same time.  The light shifts
from top to bottom and from side to side with small flares from time to time.
This is a miniature replication of the sun at midnight on some parts of the
earth.  Some great conjurer must have made this and given it to some great
person as a prize.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

This 'scrap' of cloth is actually a perfect rectangle and has nicely finished

it seems to be reinforced with bands of padding, making it comfortable to wear.
It could easily be tied to the forearm, and would probably blend in well with

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.

extradesc: goggles pair mining mining-goggles
This is a pair of fine goggles, made of expertly tanned leather and lenses of
thick glass.  Excellent for protecting the eyes from the loose dust and
occasional hazards in a mine, they would probably also be useful outdoors in a
sandstorm, though underwater use would probably ruin the leather and is not
recommended.

Translucent yet solid, the circlet is made of some unknown material, definitely
magical in nature.  When it touches light, it shimmers oddly, almost sparkling.
Cool to the touch, it hums faintly and radiates a sense of calm to anyone near
it.

extradesc: satchel canvas bag duffel
A green sailcloth bag that closes at the top with a drawstring,
this satchel seems like it'd hold a lot of stuff! Straps allow
it to be worn as well as merely held.

extradesc: bracelet feather
     Though simple in appearance, there is something more to this small
bracelet than meets the eye.  Simply holding this band of woven feathers in
your hand makes you feel stronger both of body and of mind.  Slipping it about
your wrist you discover a small sparkling gemstone mounted amidst the feathers.
