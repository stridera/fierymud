This ring is very beautiful.  The diamond is a rare blue color, accented by the
platinum it is set in.  Faint outlines of a swirling cloud motif add texture to
the ring, though barely enough to notice.  It looks like it was made for a
lady's hand...  A very wealthy lady's hand.~

The main body of this exquisite ring is made of bright silver that seems to

and larger than usual, with deep blue sapphires running otter-swift around the
main center of attention.  The ring is neither wide nor narrow, making it
wearable by either men or women.~

extradesc: memento-lover's-soul memento-lovers-soul platinum locket
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    ~

It reads,
"My thought will be for you
My love will be in you
You are the one to love me
So I will live forever"~

Made of a raw, tan-colored silk that is much heavier than normal silk, the
kimono is patterned with leaves of red, yellow, orange, and brown.  The leaves
are embroidered on with silk thread, making them shine in the light.  The body
of the kimono must have been made of raw silk so that the textures, both
tactile and visual, would complement each other.  This robe is truly a work of
art.    ~

This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.~

It seems to be a snowflake set onto a tiny silver post.  The six-pointed flake
is cool to the touch, though it does not melt.  Whatever crystal substance it
is made of catches the light quite well, giving it an ever-present sparkle.  
Its miniscule arms have hexagonal symmetry, and it is very detailed.~

The doll is a horrid looking thing: it's little, greenish, and looks like the
blob.  Under the globs of gelatinous gleaming gunk, glint the green eyes of a
gooey effigy.  Its original visage is difficult to make out, because of all the
green gelatin caked on it.  The goo is quite sticky, causing anything touching
it to become lodged in the mess.~

light liquid filling the inside of the shield that is constantly in motion.  
As hits are taken, the filling liquid moves and reacts, giving great protection
from attacks.~

Several layers of pressed birch leaves have been sewn on to tanned hide to

handle any climate or condition, even though they have seen years of use.  Odd
that the leaves still seem to be fresh, as if picked from a tree and stitched
on this morning.~

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.    ~
