Other than the fact that the lantern is larger than normal and is
made from an odd reddish metal, there is nothing particularly unusual
about the lantern. You would imagine it has a long life though.

The coral ring seems totally flawless. It is made of the finest coral
you have ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white
on the other. It is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance
so that it is not the least bit abrasive.~

wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.

This is a dark, a small fighting knife with a single blade.  In this case, the
blade is bronze, and a treated hardwood handle is securely riveted to one end.
It is well-used and the bronze has darkened with age.  Brown stains cover the
handle.

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed
hastily with clumsy hands. The teeth vary in shape and size making you
wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

This bracelet is made out of a very durable weaved grass that has several

and give the bracelet a menacing look.  The grass is a dull green color and it
is weaved tightly so it looks almost like it is one piece of grass.

This is a triangular iron badge, whose front has been painted bright orange.  
In the middle of the orange field is a claw, perhaps of a large reptile,
severed two-thirds of the way from the tip, and painted black.
