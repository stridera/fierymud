Crafted from a solid shard of hardened night, the ring refuses to let even
light caress it.  The band is thin yet does not seem weak by far.  A small
place at the top feels very thick and round.  At a straight look it is almost
like one could see movement from inside.~

whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no

this face appears to have been peeled off whole from someone, then prepared to
be worn as some kind of hat.  The face feels moist, as if it was freshly

These are not so much slippers as they are actual hollowed out feet, chopped

foot was severed, and has been expertly, if not magically, preserved.  
Stitched together like shoes so as to allow anyone to wear them, the
resemblance to halfling feet is unmistakable regardless.~

large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

These wings look so real!  A metallic golden frame supports two somewhat large
wings made of some kind of silk that stretches to the point of being almost
transparent.  Some kind of sparkly things are woven into the silk, making the
wings shimmer as they move.~

Grotesque and ugly, the severed goat's head oozes blood from its neck just
below the jawbone.  Its whitish hair is stained and matted, clumping and
sticking in knots.  A limp pinkish tongue droops out of its mouth between rows
of vicious-looking teeth, forming a puddle of horrid-smelling drool beneath it.~

Once golden-haired with a beautiful, rich brown mane, this lion's head is now
severed from its body, clotted blood matting the edges of its hair.  A terrible
expression of wrath and anguish is locked onto its face, hinting at its
agonizing downfall.  Much of the insides of the head have long fallen out,
leaving a hideously gross interior large enough to fit another head in.    ~

exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used

The eyelids are missing, and small strings are attached which go around the

  &3&b***POINTS OF INTEREST***&0
   |&1&b1&0: There are far too many interesting things that go on in the theatre to 
   |   list them all here.  The players also tend to roam around theatre so
   |   pinning them to one spot is impossible.  So start here, talk to the
   |   Leading Player, and enjoy the magic (and madness) of... The Theatre!

Pog's notes on the Brushland Region:
Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food
make this area a haven for all sorts of creatures of the forest.

My soul is happy to see this.~

the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,

Made of a rough, heavy silk, the cloak is a tan color lined in white and,
judging by the way the fabric drapes, would sweep out impressively behind
anyone wearing it.  The dragon symbol is set in the center of the back, showing
a pale dragon done in metallic thread shimmering in the light, standing rampant
with a five-taloned foot raised as if in greeting.  The dragon looks, as
dragons tend to, extremely fierce.  Inside the collar in gray thread is the
maker's mark stitched into the fabric, but it is faint enough that it cannot be
read.~

These gloves seem very thick and would probably protect the wearer from heat.
Most useful for a smith or armourer.  They seem to give off small puffs of
white powder when they are beaten though?~

Hmm, the white powder seems to be asbestos.  Lovely.  Course with your
lifestyle I wouldn't think that would be the cause of your demise >;-)~

extradesc: lewis's-breastplate breast-plate beautiful steel
A shining plate, made of pressed felt and painted to look like steel, decorated
with elaborate designs, looks like it might actually hold up well in combat.  
Sculpted to fight a very well muscled warrior, this plate is a bit larger than
a normal one.  This isn't an item you would normally think of as a stage prop.~

This beautiful cloak is made of some kind of silky white fabric sewn all over
with the most amazing white feathers.  Each full, white feather has a single
dark blue dot near its tip, giving the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it
turns from white to dappled.  The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body,
with a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at the waist.~

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.~

You realize what this is, it is the horn of the mythical unicorn. Amazing!~

Looking directly at this strange wispy spark, you develop a distinct sense of

your eyes, a mix of ecstatic excitement and serene comfort washes over you as
you begin to hear far away laughter and music.~

Crafted from a solid shard of hardened night, the ring refuses to let even
light caress it.  The band is thin yet does not seem weak by far.  A small
place at the top feels very thick and round.  At a straight look it is almost
like one could see movement from inside.~
