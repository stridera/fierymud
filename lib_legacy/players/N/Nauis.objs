This is no natural gem!  It's the eye of a Hiver Queen, detached from its

extradesc: snake-fang-bracelet small fangs
This bracelet is made out of a very durable weaved grass that has several
spaced out snake fangs weaved into it.  The fangs are about an inch in length
and give the bracelet a menacing look.  The grass is a dull green color and it
is weaved tightly so it looks almost like it is one piece of grass.~

Examining the bracelet closer, you see images of fierce boars somehow printed
on it.  You're now quite sure how, or even what exact material the bracelet is
made of, though you suspect some kind of magically treated boar skin.~

Here is a bracelet - it is decent, although you probably already have bette@0r.
It is level 20, so too high for Naigus now, but thought it might serve we well in the future.
Stats:
2 AC, +5 HP. !CLERIC and !SORC.

If it is not useful, feel free to toss it.
It comes from the Bayou off ghost and zombie pirates!

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell

other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

Made of a raw, tan-colored silk that is much heavier than normal silk, the
kimono is patterned with leaves of red, yellow, orange, and brown.  The leaves
are embroidered on with silk thread, making them shine in the light.  The body
of the kimono must have been made of raw silk so that the textures, both
tactile and visual, would complement each other.  This robe is truly a work of
art.    ~

This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.    ~

Poorly constructed of rough wood with a thick layer of tightly stretched camel
hide over it, this shield nevertheless does its job, standing between its
wearer and attackers.  It appears to have seen quite the history of violence,
with numerous gashes and dents in the hide, but still holds together somehow.~

It is a wooden cane, just long enough to hold onto its bulbous end and use to
aid in walking.  It's slightly dinged up from time and the elements, but it
