This small watercraft is oval-shaped, with a single small bench in the middle.
It is constructed of a round frame of branches over which the skins of buffalo
have been stretched.  It looks like it's limited to a single human-sized
occupant.  The bottom is stained much darker than the rest, apparently due to
the body of water in which it has spent much time: Black Lake.
