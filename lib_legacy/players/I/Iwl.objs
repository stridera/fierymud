These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

The yellow of this flower is so deep and shiny that it's reflected off any
surface brought near.  The stem is still green and unwilted, so it can't have
been picked long ago.    ~
