This is no natural gem! It's the eye of a Hiver Queen, detached from its
socket. The many eye facets that once gazed upon the world with ambitious
lust still gleam faintly in death.

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed
hastily with clumsy hands. The teeth vary in shape and size making you
wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

This is no ordinary cape -- it's that special kind used in
swordplay. A fabric handle is sewn into its center, making
it obvious that you hold it there. Those swirling folds of
black and white satin would easily confound an opponent,
allowing you to seize their weapon in the satin.

Pog's notes on the Brushland Region:
Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food
make this area a haven for all sorts of creatures of the forest.

My soul is happy to see this.

extradesc: cloak royal-purple-cloak purple velvet golden-edged pool soft
From a distance, this cloak is perfect in detail, but when viewed up close, it
clearly fits the phrase 'good enough for stage'.  It's still quite a piece of
work though, lined in darker purple silk and trimmed in gold.  A golden cord
clasped in a large brooch ties the cloak to the wearer's neck.
