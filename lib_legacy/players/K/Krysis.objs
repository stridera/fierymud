These pants are full-cut, made from good solid tan leather. Though hardly
fashionable, at least with the dignified crowd, they're oddly appealing to
most people. At least they'll afford their wearer's legs with some

These work boots are made of dark brown leather. They go about calf-high,

along its edges. They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable
