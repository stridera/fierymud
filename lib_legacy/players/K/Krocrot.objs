extradesc: fire-ring glittering-metal-ring wreathed flames
A reward for completing a single, perfect act, this weapon is as deadly as it
is entrancing.  The flames around the ring leap and swirl, dancing in an almost
hypnotic pattern.  Though the ring gives off light and heat, it isn't hot
enough to burn your hand when you touch it.  The flames wrap around your fist,
joining you with the ring in one perfect flame.~

found in the hills.  It has a wooden handle, wound with sinew, attached to one
end.  Though small, it is quite sharp.~
