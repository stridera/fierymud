This is no natural gem! It's the eye of a Hiver Queen, detached from its
socket. The many eye facets that once gazed upon the world with ambitious
lust still gleam faintly in death.

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed

wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~
