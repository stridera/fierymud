extradesc: coral ring coral-ring
The coral ring seems totally flawless. It is made of the finest coral
you have ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white
on the other. It is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance
so that it is not the least bit abrasive.~

This is the hind end of a larger piece of bread.  It consists almost entirely
of crust, now hard and stale.  There is nothing particularly wrong with it, but
appetizing it is not.

Green apples are just fine to eat, but don't try to make a meal of them, unless
you have plenty of extra toilet paper handy.  This one is about the size of a
halfling's fist.  It is bright green without any major blemishes.

This is no natural gem! It's the eye of a Hiver Queen, detached from its
socket. The many eye facets that once gazed upon the world with ambitious
lust still gleam faintly in death.

Dried and roasted, some acorns are edible without much processing.  Hopefully,
this is one of those, as a mouthful of tannin is nobody's idea of a nice snack.

Green apples are just fine to eat, but don't try to make a meal of them, unless
you have plenty of extra toilet paper handy.  This one is about the size of a
halfling's fist.  It is bright green without any major blemishes.
