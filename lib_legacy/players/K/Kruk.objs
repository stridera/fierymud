The fan looks much more threatening than your run-of-the-mill fan! For
starters, its rods are made of black-lacquered wood. Instead of finely
painted rice paper over the rods, you see thick white cloth, with a
golden ball painted on both sides. It could hang folded from your hand,
and then, with a flick of your wrist, it could extend, becoming quite a
parrying device.~

It has a tough outer skin, but feels slightly squishy around the center
portion.  On both ends of the fruit are browned nubs.  One end looks as if it

&0This neatly rolled parchment looks quite new, perhaps two weeks old at
the most.  Its crisp white paper is nicely kept, as is the swirling blue
text that has been scrawled along its surface:

Do not worry, Lord Gundbard.  The key is safe with me.  I apologize for
abandoning my post, but rumors were abound of trouble near Fangron
Forest.  My oath bound me to protect the innocent, so I must leave
immediately to offer my aid.  I should be back within a week's time.

Sir Gloris Whiteblade,
Holy Templar

This backpack is able to contain a large selection of goods, but its bulky
size makes it quite heavy. It is crafted from a fine waterproof leather,
and seems capable of resisting most adverse weather conditions.
