This long robe is crafted from a deep blood red crimson.  It comes with a
matching sash, used to tighten it about the waist.  Not very effective in
combat, but better then nothing.~

This backpack is able to contain a large selection of goods, but its bulky
size makes it quite heavy. It is crafted from a fine waterproof leather,
and seems capable of resisting most adverse weather conditions.~

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!
     (Hint : you need something to write on...then
      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)~
