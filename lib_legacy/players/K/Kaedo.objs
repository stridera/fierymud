This cool-looking shirt is made of finely woven white cotton gauze,
woven into a loose-fitting shirt with long sleeves caught at the
wrists and a stand-up collar. The collar laces shut with cream-
colored ribbon. Not only is it the height of fashion, but it
seems immensely comfortable.

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.
