This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside
of the ball cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small
sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

As your eyes focus on the darkness, it resolves itself into a shape: a set of
fine plate armor.  Looking closer, it seems more and more solid the closer you
look, until you can make out even the tiny details of its forging: flame marks,
tiny rivulets of a darker black, and almost imperceptible silver runes which
cover it and catch what light escapes the deep shadows.  Power pulses from it,
and it seems quite ancient.

extradesc: bracers-loong embellished-sapphire-bracers chinese-dragon-bracers
Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

extradesc: book
The worn out leather book binding is almost falling apart.  It is very old
and the leather is well oiled from being handed by unclean hands.  The pages in
the book are hand written with a variety of inks giving light to the idea that
the pages were written on different days as if a journal would be.  You can
read a few of the first pages: page1, page2 and page3.
~
extradesc: page3
For all that are powerful
Bringing fists down on the weak
Smashing their souls
And breaking the meek

May they soon meet their maker
Brought forth for their misdeed
Wrought down into the ground
Stomped flat their greed

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence 
Then let us to ascend
~

   The quaint sounds of spring fill my ears with a joy not found else where.  
The breeze showers my skin with the sensations of the air.  This feeling
empowers me with the creativity that is unrivaled by others.  Like floating on
top of the world without the weight of gravity to pull me down.

............THOUGHTS............
   Thoughts drain like water
  Down into the consciousness 
   Collected in a small form
Then spread out to be recollected 
  Rearranged and transformed 
Until they collide with perfection 
     Forming what would be
          What could be
 The greatest thought of them all

The book is leatherbound, and masterfully made, with thick paper pages. 
Written there, in flowing, well-trained script, you read:

   Day 22, Month of the Winter Wolf
   My men go out today to battle the Frost Elves across the mountains. I do 
   not know how to prepare my troops. Yesterday, Lady Rill sent her Amazons 
   to assist me in Queen Serazais' mad quest, but I do not know if even 
   they will make much difference in this fight. We are outnumbered. That 
   obscene little man Serazais sent me, that outlander necromancer, last 
   night cast a spell he said would protect us, but I don't believe it'll 
   work. Ah!-- I hear the war-trumpets. Pray to whatever gods you pray to 
   that at least some of us will return alive, my dearest Thraja.

This is the last entry in the book. You see no further entries in the 
beautifully crafted journal.

extradesc: book tome
The book is large and heavy, and is sealed with red wax.  Large, golden words
are set in its cover.  There is a tingling sensation as you touch this tome,
making you realise that this must be a book of power.  One of its stories tells
of a visit from a band of powerful sorcerers who were impressed with Neris'
kindness and presented her with a holy scarab that has some power to it.  The
leader of the sorcerers is shown speaking aloud to Neris refering to her as
"Neris'Kaan", or "Neris the Kind".

Constructed from a large bough of an evergreen tree, twisted back upon
itself into a large circle, this wreath smells with the wonderous winter
scent of Christmas.  Various pine cones and berries are tied into the
wreath, and a large red bow on one side adds a vibrant splash of color
to the decoration.  The hole in the center is fairly wide, probably
large enough to fit over your head...

The shield has many dents in it but seems quite sturdy. The surface of the
shield is painted with images of heroism and valor. It original owner was
surely a mighty warrior who held these values in high esteem.
