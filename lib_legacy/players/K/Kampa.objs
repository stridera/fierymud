This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

judging by the way the fabric drapes, would sweep out impressively behind
anyone wearing it.  The dragon symbol is set in the center of the back, showing
a pale dragon done in metallic thread shimmering in the light, standing rampant
with a five-taloned foot raised as if in greeting.  The dragon looks, as
dragons tend to, extremely fierce.  Inside the collar in gray thread is the
maker's mark stitched into the fabric, but it is faint enough that it cannot be
read.

Of all things, dragon skin is incredibly rare.  The scales are hard and a dark
black color.  Each scale is the size of man's kneecap, connected from
underneath solidly.

   The chestplate is pure silver in color, radiating in the light and
reflecting it back with a bit more intensity.  The metal has been polished and
kept very clean, even though there are minor imperfections such as sword marks
and small dents.  There are markings along the sides, etched into the metal.  
The markings bear the letters SH and are surrounded by runes of some sort.

Resembling a large heater shield, there is a heraldic design emblazoned
upon it. It is said that this shield was forged by the Gods themselves in
the beginning of the world.

How grotesque.  Some person's face - sex now indistinguishable - was stripped
to provide this awful covering.  No hairs remain on it anywhere, and it has
been tanned to prevent deterioration and to give it a supple, smooth feel.  
The eyelids are missing, and small strings are attached which go around the
wearer's ears.

The shield is round, with good, sturdy handles on its back for gripping it and
keeping it close to the body for defense.  It is made of steel overlaid on
wood, and the steel is bossed in silver, and shined to a high sheen.  The
design of a lion is etched into the center of the shield, a quick but detailed
job.

This shield is made of bright blue-white steel, but it glows with
a faint pink aura. The design on the front is ancient and very
familiar, though you can't immediately place it for now. And if 
you put your ear against its softly thrumming surface, you can
hear what seems to be a lullaby, in a strong female voice touched
with gentleness.

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same
way that a deadly sword is beautiful. She's exactly like a sword --
whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.
