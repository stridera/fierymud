This is a six-foot length of dull black links.  The dark, sullen metal from
which they were forged reflects little light.  The links are nearly
rectangular, and lie almost flat due to a clever design.  The claw at the end
is rectangular as well, except that its pointed tine juts outward at a small
angle.  The claw is perhaps double the size of a link.  Stains and scratches
abound on this weapon.

This is a dark, a small fighting knife with a single blade.  In this case, the
blade is bronze, and a treated hardwood handle is securely riveted to one end.
It is well-used and the bronze has darkened with age.  Brown stains cover the
handle.

extradesc: heart fiery-wisp-heart wisp fiery orange ember
This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light
is so bright as to hurt the eyes, yet it is only a bit warm to the touch.  
Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead
of glass.

Salt is one of the oldest and simplest spices known to man.  In some ancient
lands, soldiers were paid in salt.  It is used to preserve meat and usually
makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,
just sitting around.  It is the most common spice.

The mushroom has shrivelled as it dried, its brownish color mixing with grays
and greens.  A slimy coat of mold covers it now, encasing its limp spongey
shape in a mix of fungal growths.
