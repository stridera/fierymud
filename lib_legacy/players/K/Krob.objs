Other than the fact that the lantern is larger than normal and is
made from an odd reddish metal, there is nothing particularly unusual
about the lantern. You would imagine it has a long life though.

This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.

   The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is
both too bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.

Looking rather tattered, this long tailfeather is too beat-up to look good in a
hat.  It seems sturdy enough to use as a pen, though.

To gain your titles "The mostly brave" and "the fairly pious," do the follo@0wing:
Kill something that makes you run away
Defeat something that proves your religious devotion, but not too much
Bring back a fancy sword and shield of some kind you can't buy in a store (your choice)
Find a lesser religious icon, like a thurible or rosary beads (just examples, feel free to justify another choice!)
Do these and I shall grant you your titles!

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.

also much lighter.

You look in the putrid smelling bag.  It smells horrid and it's filled with
gristle.  It's not gourmet food, but there's a huge portion inside and it
will keep you full for a while.

Other than the fact that the lantern is larger than normal and is
made from an odd reddish metal, there is nothing particularly unusual
about the lantern. You would imagine it has a long life though.
