Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  The tattoo is a highly realistic black image
of a hawk's wing, with intricate details that capture the texture and shape of
the feathers.  The use of shading and highlights creates a sense of depth and
movement in the feathers.  It incorporates intricate swirls in the details of
the feathers, evoking the image of the moving air.~

extradesc: memento-lover's-soul memento-lovers-soul platinum locket
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    ~
extradesc: inscription
It reads,
"My thought will be for you
My love will be in you
You are the one to love me
So I will live forever"~

The whisk is only as large as a woman's hand, and made of bamboo.  Several
pieces of light bamboo have been woven together at the handle, their ends
allowed to fray to form a whisk.  It's lightweight, and its whorled strands of
bamboo would make it an excellent whisk for the powdered tea of the tea
ceremony of Odaishyozen.~

A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    ~

"My thought will be for you

Made of thin black cotton, this kimono blends in perfectly with the shadows of
night.  Silk would provide a telltale sheen, though it would also be lighter,
but the black-dyed cotton absorbs light rather than reflecting it.  It is
utterly silent, not even giving the usual "whoosh" of fabric when moved.  The
sleeves fall only to the elbows, providing plenty of room to swing a weapon.  ~

are embroidered on with silk thread, making them shine in the light.  The body
of the kimono must have been made of raw silk so that the textures, both
tactile and visual, would complement each other.  This robe is truly a work of

Made of thin black cotton, this kimono blends in perfectly with the shadows of
night.  Silk would provide a telltale sheen, though it would also be lighter,
but the black-dyed cotton absorbs light rather than reflecting it.  It is
utterly silent, not even giving the usual "whoosh" of fabric when moved.  The
sleeves fall only to the elbows, providing plenty of room to swing a weapon.  ~

This light blue robe is decorated with a feather pattern, identifying it as
belonging to the Phoenix Feather Resort west of Ickle.  The style is familiar
to anyone who knows the customs of Odaishyozen: it's meant to be worn in the
same way as a kimono.  Because it's made of cotton rather than silk and
designed for more casual wear, this style of robe is called a yukata.  It was
probably designed by someone from the resort who visited the Emerald Isle.~

bamboo would make it an excellent whisk for the powdered tea of the tea

rice paper over the rods, you see thick white cloth, with a golden ball painted
on both sides.  It could hang folded from your hand, and then, with a flick of

From Arseynh Z'Kenian
Z'Kenian House
Dheduu

Regarding the status of your request.  House Z'Kenian is more than
willing to trade soulsteel in exchange for thawkinixa, however
be aware that this is done without sanction of the city's ruling
body, House Kar'Shezden.  As such, we are unable to comply with the
second part of your request and we are unable to free the city's
troll slaves in exchange for dwarven ones softened by mind control
tactics.  The secret of forging adamantium must likewise remain
with the drow until further negotiations can be made.
Should you find these conditions acceptable, please respond with
all haste.
We await your reply.~

snow.  Hang on, little people shapes are MOVING in there.  This is very
disturbing!  When shaken, the snow inside flutters around madly, but the little
people seem unaffected.    ~

Bright color catches the eye while a harlequin pattern fascinates it.  These

motion.  They provide coverage of the whole lower body, wrapping at the waist
and stretching down to the ankle, tucking into a boot or shoe.~

bamboo would make it an excellent whisk for the powdered tea of the tea

rimmed with what appears to be silver or platinum.  The image of the full moon,
flanked on either side by mirrored crescents is lightly etched in the middle of
the star.  Around the outer edge, various symbols representing the passage of
time ring the pentagram.~

At first glance this robe appears to be multicolored sparkles set against
blue-black ombre dyed fabric.  After watching it for a bit, you notice the
flecks of color subtly drift amongst the fabric, which shifts and flows as the
robe moves.  This is not just a representation of the night sky, but a
recreation of the cosmos in physical form!~

The hood is purple leather, soft as silk, ornamented with golden ribbon around
the edges.  Its lappets hang down the wearer's chest and back, allowing the
hood to fall back.  An attendant air of disaster seems to hang around this
hood, but you must admit, it is very flattering.~

From Arseynh Z'Kenian
Z'Kenian House
Dheduu

Regarding the status of your request.  House Z'Kenian is more than
willing to trade soulsteel in exchange for thawkinixa, however
be aware that this is done without sanction of the city's ruling
body, House Kar'Shezden.  As such, we are unable to comply with the
second part of your request and we are unable to free the city's
troll slaves in exchange for dwarven ones softened by mind control
tactics.  The secret of forging adamantium must likewise remain
with the drow until further negotiations can be made.
Should you find these conditions acceptable, please respond with
all haste.
We await your reply.~

but the black-dyed cotton absorbs light rather than reflecting it.  It is
utterly silent, not even giving the usual "whoosh" of fabric when moved.  The
sleeves fall only to the elbows, providing plenty of room to swing a weapon.  ~

a slightly metallic sheen, revealing its lead crystal material.  It is shaped
like half an hourglass; the top quickly narrows from a wide, rounded base and
is stopped by a small wooden cork.~

This chunk of rock is about the size of a troll's fist and made of a deep
green, striped mineral called malachite.  It's made of horizontal bands of many
different shades ranging from dark moss to the pale green of new leaves.  It is
considered a soft stone, so it is possible that it was once polished but became
chipped.  However, this green stone is often found deep inside mountains.  
What is it doing in the swamps?~

This bone is under a foot long, and clearly comes from the leg of an
unfortunate gnome.  It's highly polished, as if it were extensively handled.  
An inscription, apparently burned into the surface of the bone, starts near the
middle and spirals toward the thick end.  Its language is unknown to you.~

with only an embossing around their edges as decoration.  Leather straps hold
the spaulders tight against the shoulders and down part of the arm,

Fine purple cloth, unwrinkled linen, forms what is clearly a robe of high

As you look at the tapestry, your spirit rises from the sublime colors and
expert weaving of the piece, then falls, as you notice how ragged its edges
are, and how obviously neglected it is.  There's no way it can be repaired, you
see.  That's too bad.  If it were in better shape, it'd be worthy of a lord's
castle.  You might even want to put it in yours, if you ever get one.~

Made from a single large shell that must be grown for years, a bracer like this
is given to rangers who have demonstrated their dedication to protecting the
wilderness.  An abalone shell such as the one this is made from would be worth
a fortune on the market, but that value pales in comparison to the magical
enchantments it could contain.~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

This ring is very beautiful.  The diamond is a rare blue color, accented by the
platinum it is set in.  Faint outlines of a swirling cloud motif add texture to
the ring, though barely enough to notice.  It looks like it was made for a
lady's hand...  A very wealthy lady's hand.~

and up the calves. The leather is thick, and a kind of magical

after Ogakh was established as a permanent settlement and most of the Army

Shaped like a tiny bluejay, this whistle is carved from a single block of wood.
It is hollowed out inside, and a tiny flap in the beak vibrates when the
whistle is blown, making a twittering whistle.    ~

&0This neatly rolled parchment looks quite new, perhaps two weeks old at
the most.  Its crisp white paper is nicely kept, as is the swirling blue
text that has been scrawled along its surface:

Do not worry, Lord Gundbard.  The key is safe with me.  I apologize for
abandoning my post, but rumors were abound of trouble near Fangron
Forest.  My oath bound me to protect the innocent, so I must leave
immediately to offer my aid.  I should be back within a week's time.

Sir Gloris Whiteblade,
Holy Templar~

extradesc: jerkin suit-patchy-hide-armor fur-trimmer-hide-jerkin 
This large suit of armor is made from several large sections of tanned hide,
stitched together in layers with sinews and cord.  The hides clearly come from
several different creatures, lacking uniformity of texture or color.  A full
broad collar and shoulder pads have been collaged together, and the panels hang
long, covering some of the hips and waist for full coverage of the torso.  
Some of the sections have fur pressed between them, and other parts are
embellished with fox tails and other large fur pads.  The overall effect is a
patchy, mangy look.~

The flower resembles a perfect looking daisy, and is yellow in color.
The flower smells good enough to eat, and just looking at it makes you
kind of hungry. The more you study the flower, the more it looks like
some type of magical food, rather than a real flower. ~

This simple silvery cord is far more than meets the eye.  Such cords represent

Made more of magic than material, such a cord is a rare and valuable treasure.~

Pog's notes on the Brushland Region:
Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food
make this area a haven for all sorts of creatures of the forest.

My soul is happy to see this.~

The staff has intricate elven runes across its length, telling of histories
long ago past.  Finely chiseled from a heavy dark brown maple wood, it has a
carved handle two-thirds of the way up so it may be held without covering any
of the runes.    ~

As you look at the small circlet you are awestruck by its beauty.  It sparkles
in the sunlight and must be worth at least a million bucks.  The circlet 
emanates a power of good, one that you wouldn't mind having for yourself.~

This kind of magical stone is also known as an Ioun stone, named for an old god
of knowledge and prophecy.  The tiny crystal is cut into the shape of a
hexagonal geometric prism -- six slender faces around a flat base.  Unlike an
optical prism, this crystal does not bend light in any spectacular way, but
does color it vaguely rose-hued.~

What can only be described as liquid light has collected into a small fluid
pool.  Picking it up, the pool splits into two small droplets of equal size.  
Strangely, they do not leave any smears or traces behind, remaining perfectly
coherent.~

Just looking at these sandals makes you feel more capable of 
moving quickly. Leather straps hold the wearer's feet into a
leather-covered footbed; the straps crisscross over the ankles
and up the calves. The leather is thick, and a kind of magical
aura around the sandals makes them blur out of sight a little.~

The whisk is only as large as a woman's hand, and made of bamboo.  Several
pieces of light bamboo have been woven together at the handle, their ends
allowed to fray to form a whisk.  It's lightweight, and its whorled strands of
bamboo would make it an excellent whisk for the powdered tea of the tea
ceremony of Odaishyozen.~

This blade shines with a bright light whenever it is in the presence of 
something or someone good.  It is used by the Undead Lord to protect his
mausoleum and afterlife.  Being so white it is difficult to perceive exactly
where the edges are, so I'd be careful with it.~

extradesc: gloves blades bladed
The gloves each feature 3 long blades originating from the top of the hand.  
When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.    ~

some kind down its blade.  The hilt is forged with the blade as one piece

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

You behold the legendary Stormcloak, once worn by the mighty Stormlord, Holder
of Tempests, himself.  The dark indigo cloth the cloak is made of scintillates,
giving the impression of thousands of tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into
its brocade surface.  It's quite heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held
together by a bronze clasp, beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon
whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you
look at it, touch it.~

This cloak was once quite fancy and shaped perfectly.  Now, however, it is torn
and somewhat discolored.  The silvery lining is shredded and has lost its glint
and sparkle.  The owner of such a cloak must have been quite wealthy, and it is
a wonder why such a precious item would go to waste.  It has a lone, long faded
symbol across the back.~

This large cloak is made from the fur of a giant lynx.  The material is smooth
and the workmanship is flawless.  The interior of the cloak is lined with a
white fur, maybe snow rabbit or snow leopard.  The clasp is made of gold and is
carved to appear like some sort of winged snake.  This cloak appears very, very
valuable.~

Yeenoghu, warrior-shamans imbued directly with a demonic spirit by Yeenoghu

attached to a sturdy haft.  A bulging eye is drawn on each orb in blood, an
invocation of Yeenoghu to watch the butchery committed in his name.~

As you look at the tapestry, your spirit rises from the sublime colors and
expert weaving of the piece, then falls, as you notice how ragged its edges
are, and how obviously neglected it is.  There's no way it can be repaired, you
see.  That's too bad.  If it were in better shape, it'd be worthy of a lord's
castle.  You might even want to put it in yours, if you ever get one.~

If the scales on this set of scalemail look familiar, perhaps it is because a
master crafstman painstakingly craft each one to resemble one of the scales of
the great black dragon, Sagece.  The scales must have been gathered during a
successful (meaning only several deaths to the party) assault upon her.  Or
perhaps the beauty of the piece of armor just provides motivation for creative
daydreaming.~

This lone horn is very large and curved.  It is cracked and broken in two
places: a large break marks the spot where it was wrenched from the mighty
demon Krisenna's head, and a smaller break is higher up.  The smaller end is
worn, as if the horns were smoothed after the injury.  Whether this was done in
battle or for vanity is impossible to tell.  Some power remains in the horn,
damaged as it is.~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically strong,
for though it is very old, there are no dents, dings, or scratches in its
shockingly blue surface.  It reflects a fierce strike of lightning as you look

This horn is made from a traditional spiral sea snail shell.  Unlike many other
horns of this type however, a small mouthpiece has been affixed to the narrow
end of the shell, making it easier to blow through and create its signature
bugling.~

occupant.  The bottom is stained much darker than the rest, apparently due to
the body of water in which it has spent much time: Black Lake.    ~

These boots are fashioned from high quality leather, sturdy enough to provide
protection but soft enough to be comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
The soles are the thick soles of traveling shoes, the kind befitting a
wandering troubadour.  Making use of vibrant dyes however, the craftsman has
created a piece of gear that wonderfully combines function with aesthetic for
some flare on the go.~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some

large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with

Where many tools dedicated to demonic forces are heavily detailed with runes
and symbols indicating their dark purpose and their masters, this blade has
none of those traditional trappings.  A blade made of blackened steel, sharp
yet unrefined, produced for one purpose only: to shed blood in the name of
Demon Lords.  On it is a single eye, the symbol of Yeenoghu, the Beast of
Butchery, so he may watch every kill up close.~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

This large weapon is a two-handed sword with a very long blade made of steel
with very little in the way of sharp edges, since it's meant for brute hacking.
The hilt is made of bronze, with bronze crossguards and little ornamentation
or decoration.  The pommel is weighted perfectly with a smooth white alabaster
stone, opaque and milky-white.  There is no sign of what the stone signifies.~

metallic substance, giving off a bluish tinted shine.  The back of the helm
comes down to cover the neckline and at the front there is a piece that drops
downward to cover the nasal area.~

The first thing you notice are the antlers of a young stag proudly affixed to
the top of this helm.  The base is hardened leather studded stretched over a
bronze frame.  It is solid and sturdy but the finishings are rough, perhaps
intentionally so, as the look evokes a charging wild creature.~

from Wyrd Weave, a substance spun from the fabric of magic itself.  Such a robe

The bracelet is formed from small beads of gold and grayish colored stones.  
It is very old and shows the marks from years of use.  The stone beads are
cracked and worn down on the edges and a few of them have chipped apart.  The
gold beads are starting to tarnish and fade, almost matching the dull luster of
the stone, from prolonged contact with the sweat from the skin.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

This spear has a short haft and a broad obsidian head.  It has poor balance and
you doubt that it would make an effective missile weapon.  However the obsidian
head is very sharp, and you feel confident you could inflict a great deal of
damage with it.~

You see a braided suede leather belt here. It's twice the length of your 
entire body. You've seen this type of belt before-- you're supposed to 
take it and wind it around your body twice, loop it in a specific way, 
and let the ends fall to your calves. It seems like it'd hamper your 
movement, if you did that, but perhaps it will benefit you to the point 
that you don't mind it doing that.~

You see a braided suede leather belt here. It's twice the length of your 
entire body. You've seen this type of belt before-- you're supposed to 
take it and wind it around your body twice, loop it in a specific way, 
and let the ends fall to your calves. It seems like it'd hamper your 
movement, if you did that, but perhaps it will benefit you to the point 
that you don't mind it doing that.~

The iridescent sword gleams in the light, almost like its giving off some light

middle with a blood groove, from tip to shoulder.  The handle of the sword is
wrapped in what looks to be dragon skin, sewn together with a golden twine.  
There is a small inscription on the pommel.~

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically strong,
for though it is very old, there are no dents, dings, or scratches in its
shockingly blue surface.  It reflects a fierce strike of lightning as you look
at it.  But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....~

A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.~

Upon closer inspection, you realize this isn't gold at all, just pyrite, also
known as "fool's gold" or "kobold gold.  " Even though it's not work much,
pyrite still makes lovely jewelry.  This tiny nugget is mounted to a small
post, making it a large statement piece for a kobold or a a tiny spec for an

extradesc: moonlight swirls-moonlight moon-light pale-light-swirls tiny-pool
You pick up what can only be described as liquid light, gently swirling in a
small pool.  The pool splits into two small droplets of equal size, each alight
with similar incandescence.  Strangely, they do not leave any smears or traces
behind, remaining perfectly coherent.~

This shield is made of bright blue-white steel, but it glows with a faint pink
aura.  The design on the front is ancient and very familiar, though you can't
immediately place it for now.  And if you put your ear against its softly
thrumming surface, you can hear what seems to be a lullaby, in a strong female
voice touched with gentleness.~

You hold some unknown, almost ethereal material which has been fashioned into a
cloak.  Its silver-blue color and innate luminescence makes it quite unlike any
mundane fabric.  Amazingly soft to the touch, it seems this cloak was woven
from the light of the moon itself.~

larger piece of artwork.  Judging from the condition of the leather, this has

A reward for completing a single, perfect act, this weapon is as deadly as it
is entrancing.  The flames around the ring leap and swirl, dancing in an almost
hypnotic pattern.  Though the ring gives off light and heat, it isn't hot
enough to burn your hand when you touch it.  The flames wrap around your fist,
joining you with the ring in one perfect flame.~

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same
way that a deadly sword is beautiful. She's exactly like a sword --
whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.~

You've never seen such exquisite goldworking.  This locket, on its whisper-thin
golden link necklace, seems very old.  The hinges on it are coming a bit loose,
but it's still pretty tightly closed.~

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same
way that a deadly sword is beautiful. She's exactly like a sword --
whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.~

A slender golden band with delicate whorls of knotwork is the setting for a
rather remarkable gem.  Though it is a small sapphire, no bigger than a wheat
kernel, it is shaped into the form of a hawk descending onto ints prey, talons
outsretched.  It was surely crafted by magic, for what gemcrafter, no matter
how skilled, could perfectly replicate something that small and detailed?~

This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

extradesc: broadsword broad-sword alabaster-pommelled-broadsword alabaster-pommel
This large weapon is a two-handed sword with a very long blade made of steel
with very little in the way of sharp edges, since it's meant for brute hacking.
The hilt is made of bronze, with bronze crossguards and little ornamentation
or decoration.  The pommel is weighted perfectly with a smooth white alabaster
stone, opaque and milky-white.  There is no sign of what the stone signifies.~

It feels almost fluffy and very weightless.  It becomes more clearly defined in
the light, appearing to be more like black cloth, yet when in the shadows it
fades until it is barely visible.  Cloaked in shadow, it would be easy to
remain hidden wherever there is darkness.~

Though the spider is made entirely aout of black and silver metal, it crawls

back and two of its eight legs extend into a lopp so that it can be worn around
the wrist as a bracelet.  Its tiny ruby eyes wink up at you as you contemplate
it.~

This is a six-foot length of dull black links.  The dark, sullen metal from
which they were forged reflects little light.  The links are nearly
rectangular, and lie almost flat due to a clever design.  The claw at the end
is rectangular as well, except that its pointed tine juts outward at a small
angle.  The claw is perhaps double the size of a link.  Stains and scratches
abound on this weapon.~

About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.~

extradesc: bracers-loong embellished-sapphire-bracers chinese-dragon-bracers
Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

Made of a rough, heavy silk, the cloak is a tan color lined in white and,
judging by the way the fabric drapes, would sweep out impressively behind
anyone wearing it.  The dragon symbol is set in the center of the back, showing
a pale dragon done in metallic thread shimmering in the light, standing rampant
with a five-taloned foot raised as if in greeting.  The dragon looks, as
dragons tend to, extremely fierce.  Inside the collar in gray thread is the
maker's mark stitched into the fabric, but it is faint enough that it cannot be
read.~

About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far from
here.  It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much lighter, lucky
for you!  The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's slightly clenched
clawed forefoot.  But it's fallen on hard times--its handle is broken, and its
surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft and balance.  It's still quite
usable, though no experienced warrior would be interested in wielding it, since
its power is greatly reduced because of its condition.  But a junior trainee
would be thrilled to have this once-impressive weapon.~

These leggings are made of a magically hardened ice called ice-steel.

The sword isn't very fancy - it is made of a dull metal, and strips of cloth

extradesc: bracelet goddess-bracelet piece-pearl questobject
It is a fine bracelet that looks like it was carved from one large pearl, with
a twisting whorled design inlaid with gold.  It fits over the wrist, sliding on
without a clasp or hinge.  It glows with the lustrous inner light that only the
finest pearls have.~

extradesc: ring goddess-pearl-ring exquisite-pearl-ring questobject
The main body of this exquisite ring is made of bright silver that seems to
glow aquamarine-blue with an inner light.  The pearl that adorns it is stunning
and larger than usual, with deep blue sapphires running otter-swift around the
main center of attention.  The ring is neither wide nor narrow, making it
wearable by either men or women.~

This chunk of rock is about the size of a troll's fist and made of a deep
green, striped mineral called malachite.  It's made of horizontal bands of many
different shades ranging from dark moss to the pale green of new leaves.  It is
considered a soft stone, so it is possible that it was once polished but became
chipped.  However, this green stone is often found deep inside mountains.  
What is it doing in the swamps?~

making it quite warm but bearable to the touch.  It seems to impart some of its

An airy-light robe of the finest silk shimmers and shines in the light,
reflecting many colors that change as it is moved.  Every color in the rainbow
is represented here and there, though if the fabric is moved the colors shift
again.  It looks like it is all made of one solid piece of fabric, hemmed only
at the collar and the sleeves.  It looks like it would be loose but comfortable
to wear.~

vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and flowing to the calves.
The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in golden thread in a criss-cross
pattern.  The double-breasted collar is embroidered as well, in golden
four-pointed stars.  It'd look perfect with a silk blouse and breeches.~

This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.    ~

Feather-light silk is artfully sewn into leggings, gathered at the waist and
tied with a light string of the same fabric.  The silk is many-colored,
changing as it is moved and shimmering in the light.  They look like they would
be rather baggy, but comfortable - how not, as they are made of the finest
silk?~

An airy-light robe of the finest silk shimmers and shines in the light,
reflecting many colors that change as it is moved.  Every color in the rainbow
is represented here and there, though if the fabric is moved the colors shift
again.  It looks like it is all made of one solid piece of fabric, hemmed only
at the collar and the sleeves.  It looks like it would be loose but comfortable
to wear.~

can withstand quite a bit of damage.  They are padded on the inside with white
fur, preventing the frigid white metal from touching skin.  The plate metal is
slightly curved and much thinner than average steel, undoubtedly created by
some uncomprehensible elven miracle.~

The elaborate elven crest is painted on the front of the sleet shield with
amazing detail.  It depicts a great lynx running on a blue background, with a
waving banner above it.  Some ancient elven runes are written across the
banner, but below the crest, the name Shiran appears in common script.    ~

pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a

Some of the pages seem to be marked, in particular page16 and page37
which talk about future directions for more powerful spellcasters and
how to encode a simple cipher respectively.

The preface briefly states how essential it is for a spellcaster to
protect his spells against accidental or deliberate theft, by encoding
them.~
extradesc: page16
A passage has been circled on this page, it reads:
    ...so in order to ensure that the magic user has a copious supply of
willing subjects for his experiments, he must first ingratiate himself with
his chosen town by generous acts. An intelligent mage will try and get
himself accepted into the council, and perhaps even move for a law which can
be used to aid him. This could state that all mad people be locked up, or
all criminals be killed. We all know how easy it is to turn a mind to madness
and the mage may then take these subjects 'under his protection' and
experiment on them without worry, as the populace soon forget what has
happened to them...

There is also a note in the margin which seems to be a calculation of some
sort and a reference to page23.~
extradesc: page23
Ack, its a recipe for unlimited power, but it involves several unsavoury
ingredients including human organs. A passage has been circled on this page
too, and it reads:
    ...obviously in order to get this many human hearts is impossible
which is why this spell still remains theoretical, although if one were
to perfect some sort of cloning technique, coupled with a spell for creation
of a human, then it might be possible to create a human with many vestigial
organs which would presumably still be valid for the recipe...

Your skin crawls as you continue to read, anyone who really thought this
sort of stuff would work would have to be mad right?~
extradesc: page37
There are some simple ciphers on the page here, and some notes in the margin
which look like the would have continued onto page 38, only that page has
been torn out of the book! You read the notes anyway and puzzle over the
missing data:
    ...and as has been known through history the simplest cipher is a
substitution whereby one letter is substituted for another (for example
the next letter in the alphabet) and the message is rewritten. The decoder
knows that the letters are shifted by a certain number of positions and
can easily decode the message. This is known as a monoalphabetic cipher. A
more complex 'polyalphabetic' cipher such as the Vigenere cipher may also
be used. The illustration on the next page shows this in action, but basically
the implementation is as follows:
     1) the keyword is chosen and repeatedly written below the phrase to be encoded
     2) the combination of keyword letter and phrase letter are used to index  the Vigenere tableau
     3) the indexed letters form the encoded phrase
And the decryption works in reverse, going down the column indexed by the
keyword letter to the encoded letter, and determining which letter heads that
row. Obviously a keyword of all 'a' would not encrypt at all.
The page ends here!~

Unfortunately, this page has been ripped from the book.~

9th day of the Month of Discovery, 352

   If your reading this, well, the plans didn't go off correctly.  I wanted a
legacy to carry on.  This tower was to be it.  In my days, I saw many places,
full of traps and treachery, but also of wealth and other spoils.  I strived to
leave such a place myself.  Alas, I plan on destroying these notes when it is
done, thus if you are reading this, the tower is not.  As I write this, the
enchanted tower has been completed ; a grand four stories tall.  It's too bad I
will be destroying part of it soon.  . .
 
  Work will not be finished for months, I fear, and with my ailing health, I
may not live to see it done.  I've called upon many favors - I'm afraid even my
soul will be the cost in the end.  So far, there's not much loot in here, most
has been sold for the protectors of the castle.  Sweet irony.    

   In the end, I have turned to demons to protect the lair, and slave labor to
build it.  What have I become.  Perhaps this is what is truly killing me.  Tis
only luck that the blue dragon has made the tower his perch.  What would it
cost for such a guardian?    

The writing continues in part2, part3, part4, part5, part6, part7~
extradesc: part2
   First, I ask myself, why am I building this tower?  I have adventured for
many years, and have always been fascinated by places I had gone, both in the
architecture, and the secrets held within.  I have decided to leave a legacy
behind me.  Someone has to die for a tomb to be looted.    

   Alas, with a life of adventure came a life with no heirs, so my money is
worthless after I die anyhow.  I am still in good health now, but getting older
every day.  Thus, my life's goal.    

   I have enlisted a few of my more mystical friends for the construction.  
This shall be no ordinary tower, by any means.  For one, we have concocted an
enchantment for the stone of the tower, such that it shall rebuild itself if
e'er it gets destroyed.  The bits of stone are attacted to one another, such
that no matter the distance, they will slowly be pulled together again.  Yea,
it may take millenia if they are far apart, but the tower shall never be
destroyed.    ~
extradesc: part3
   This was quite costly, but I believe it will be a good investment in the
long run.  No matter what happens, the tower will never quite die.    
 
   The basement has been created.  We decided upon an infinite hallway to
protect my study.  It too wasn't terribly hard to create, merely a modified
dimension door spell.  I had to give up my grandmother's broach, though, to get
the work done.  My friends are quite stingy, they are.    

   Finding workers from an area far enough away that they won't be able to find
their way back was quite tough.  The southern continent was a good choice.  To
get back without help, they'd have to raft the blue fog sea.  I've ne'er seen a
bigger ship down there in my days.  Getting them back there will be tougher.  
Our ride got called off to tend to her father, dying of old age. ~
extradesc: part4
   Had the druid community not severed ties with me after the unfortunate
incident in the forest...  I hadn't honestly meant to hurt anything, especially
not the animals, and how was I to know that the owl was a shapechanger...  
Life would be much easier. 

   We just had a few incidents in the construction.  The sub basement floor
collapsed.  It turns out a giant worm has burrowed under the tower.  It turns
out to have some intelligence, I think.  I... agreed to keep it fed if it
did no damage.  I didn't realize how much it eats.  We may need to exterminate
it.    

   Some fool put a door on the second floor of the tower to the outside.  
Unfortunately, they're nothing outside of it.  I've locked it to avoid any more
accidents.  Two deaths were bad enough.  Perhaps they would have survived, but
evidently the door happened to lead right above where the worm had burrowed,
thus the pit was quite deep.    ~
extradesc: part5
   Part of our labor force has decided to abandon the project.  A few of
them...  Were threatening to break their vow.  I had to put them down.  I think
the rest will understand the graveness of the situation, and will realize the
penalties for betraying me.    

   The work force has mutinied.  After hearing tales of what I did to those
that left, they snuck out after I offered them a two day break.  I will track
them down one by one and punish them all.  Traitors.  First, though, I must
find a replacement work force...  Work most continue - the tower must be
completed I have taken ill as of late, quite severely.  I hope it will pass,
but I must press on in case it does not.  I am ...  Seeking connections at the
moment.    

   I have sought an audience with the Demon Lord Krisenna.  We have struck a
deal; he seems quite benevolent at the moment.  Hopefully it will stay that
way.  The deal works in both our favors.  They provide the workers and
protection, and I provide them with a safe entry way into our world.  They have
finished the external tower, and have retreated into the bowels to finish up.~
extradesc: part6
   I have allowed them free reign to create themselves a sealed off passageway
to keep anyone who might make their way in from getting to them.  I am not even
allowed to see what they are doing there, lest I bother them, or give others
knowledge of how to do the same thing.    ~
extradesc: part7
   I have just stumbled back across this book, and it weighs heavily on my
mind.  I have seen my soul blacken over time.  Alas, I think it is too late for
me.  They have taken almost all of my goods as tribute, and they have an iron
grip on the tower.  I plot, hoping to find a way to get rid of them, but I fear
the deal is done.~

There are some simple ciphers on the page here, and some notes in the margin
which look like the would have continued onto page 38, only that page has
been torn out of the book! You read the notes anyway and puzzle over the
missing data:
    ...and as has been known through history the simplest cipher is a
substitution whereby one letter is substituted for another (for example
the next letter in the alphabet) and the message is rewritten. The decoder
knows that the letters are shifted by a certain number of positions and
can easily decode the message. This is known as a monoalphabetic cipher. A
more complex 'polyalphabetic' cipher such as the Vigenere cipher may also
be used. The illustration on the next page shows this in action, but basically
the implementation is as follows:
     1) the keyword is chosen and repeatedly written below the phrase to be encoded
     2) the combination of keyword letter and phrase letter are used to index  the Vigenere tableau
     3) the indexed letters form the encoded phrase
And the decryption works in reverse, going down the column indexed by the
keyword letter to the encoded letter, and determining which letter heads that
row. Obviously a keyword of all 'a' would not encrypt at all.

Some of the pages seem to be marked, in particular page16 and page37
which talk about future directions for more powerful spellcasters and
how to encode a simple cipher respectively.

The preface briefly states how essential it is for a spellcaster to
protect his spells against accidental or deliberate theft, by encoding
them.~
extradesc: page16
A passage has been circled on this page, it reads:
    ...so in order to ensure that the magic user has a copious supply of
willing subjects for his experiments, he must first ingratiate himself with
his chosen town by generous acts. An intelligent mage will try and get
himself accepted into the council, and perhaps even move for a law which can
be used to aid him. This could state that all mad people be locked up, or
all criminals be killed. We all know how easy it is to turn a mind to madness
and the mage may then take these subjects 'under his protection' and
experiment on them without worry, as the populace soon forget what has
happened to them...

There is also a note in the margin which seems to be a calculation of some
sort and a reference to page23.~
extradesc: page23
Ack, its a recipe for unlimited power, but it involves several unsavoury
ingredients including human organs. A passage has been circled on this page
too, and it reads:
    ...obviously in order to get this many human hearts is impossible
which is why this spell still remains theoretical, although if one were
to perfect some sort of cloning technique, coupled with a spell for creation
of a human, then it might be possible to create a human with many vestigial
organs which would presumably still be valid for the recipe...

The book is leatherbound. It's quite old, obviously. When you open it,
a cloud of fine dust flies up, tickling your nose and stinging your eyes. 
Each of the yellowed, crumbling pages is written in the same crabbed, 
faltering handwriting. It's quite difficult to read, but you puzzle it 
out slowly. A Table of Contents says that the thin volume contains five 
separate letters. It is divided into sections by a beautiful coloured 
painting bound right into the book.
  You can look at section1, section2, section3, section4, or section5. ~
extradesc: section1
This page's facing page features a beautiful illumined picture of a man
facing a large group of demonic creatures. He holds up his glowing hands
and seems to have no fear at all in his face. The text reads:

  I have been traveling our realm for many years, and find myself
  falling to anger at the blatant slap in the face issued to the
  Order of Mielikki by Blackmourne's minions. Now, I know, being an
  old priest who has been fighting Evil for many years, that I should
  exercise discretion, that this will pass. But somehow, this latest
  assault on our charter feels different, and I have no confidence
  that the Gods of our land will protect us this time from the
  Archenemy.

  Morpheous, one of our patron gods, has been molding us for many
  years under the tutelage of the wise Kaaz clan. I suppose it is
  inevitable that our society, so deftly ruled and so wisely shepherded,
  would become a cause for jealousy. In my prayers, I have sensed the
  hatred and envy of the foul god Blackmourne. I pray he does not raise
  his hand against the world -- for if he does, who can stop a god?
  Not even the Kaaz clan could stand against all the evil a god may
  cause.

  Be ready for anything. The call to defend our gracious Goddess
  may come at any time, and we must not allow Blackmourne to prevail.


                                In Yr. Service
                                Girr'Kaaz, High Priest of Mielikki~
extradesc: section2
This section is faced with a picture of a decayed, disgusting human 
figure wearing a long, black silk robe. His face reveals no trace of 
normal human gentleness and kindness -- the cloak of his many years hangs 
very heavy on him. He's pure evil. The text on the next page reads:

  I have been traveling our realm for many years, my brothers and
  sisters in the faith, and I know that my learning is as yet not
  complete. However, bear with the words of one who is still learning:

  HOW can the Lord of Templace not demand the head of Ruin Wormheart
  on a golden plate? How can he not see the perfidy and cruelty of this
  supposed priest? Every day brings a new rumour and a new crime, and
  every day we see more of those vile Undead Knights coming into our
  beautiful cities. Wormheart is daring us to do something, my brothers.
  I pray none of us acts before the right time has come.

  Merely by reading the words of Ruin Wormheart's missives, one may
  get a feeling for the hatred of this person and those around him.
  He cloaks these evil, vile feelings in words of sweetness and light,
  but none of those who worship the Goddess can fail to see the truth.

  My warnings, brothers and sisters: Do not fall prey to this guild,
  and do not allow Ruin to provoke you... Yet. Our time will come, and
  we will wipe this degenerate guild from the face of the earth!

                                In Yr. Service
                                Girr'Kaaz, High Priest of Mielikki~
extradesc: section3
This section begins with a picture of the dwarven city, Anduin. The
city's walls are in ruins; warriors, both human and not, fight for
their very lives against a monstrous horde of demonic creatures. The
text of the message reads:

  Brethren,

  I have traveled this realm for many years now, and I hope that
  you all know me well enough to know that I would not waste your
  time without good reason or without just cause. 

  But this latest outrage demands our immediate attention! Those
  who can, journey to the twin cities at greatest haste. Those who
  cannot... Please favour your brethren with prayer and supplication.
  We will have to make our stand, and we will have to be victorious,
  or else our Guild will be wiped from the face of the earth.

  The demons that Blackmourne has called forth have already destroyed
  the city of the priests, and they have their eyes on the entire known
  world. We must act now, or we will lose the crowning city of the
  known realm to the foul creatures beyond the rift. Blackmourne has
  gained an ally in the equally evil god Angus, and together, their
  efforts in creating a rift between the demon plane, Gaar'laxxil, and
  our own has shaken the very foundations of our world. The demons know
  that should they win this war, they will feast on the fruits of our
  very world. What folly have we bred in endeavouring to create good!

                                In Yr. Service
                                Girr'Kaaz, High Priest of Mielikki~
extradesc: section4
This last section begins with a barely-colored painting of what must
be the City of Templace in its glory years. You recognize the Bronze
Golems and the huge gates immediately. In front of it are three human
figures, facing two huge humanoid figures. And above the two huge men
flies the biggest dragon you have ever seen... The text of the letter
reads:

  My brethren, I write to you with unfortunate news. I was in the
  city when the greatest atrocity of our age occurred, and it is with
  the heaviest of hearts that I pass these words on to you. Templace
  is destroyed, and it can never be rebuilt, and the devastation to
  the nearby area will never be undone!

  Angus and Blackmourne opened a rift in the very fabric of this plane, 
  bringing forth horrors from beyond it that no one's mind could 
  comprehend. But our fair Templace stood strong through all the 
  attacks. In desperation, they called forth the great black dragon
  Sagece from the Plane of Gaar'laxxil. As the beast stepped through
  the rift, her delicate foot-claws grazed the surface of the lake near
  Templace, and it turned black as coal in that moment.

  Our leaders, the great Kaaz clan, defied the assembled evils of the
  very gods, but the great dragon had help of the vilest sort -- from
  the direct hand of Blackmourne himself. Girr'Kaaz's power was such that
  without Blackmourne's aid, Sagece could never have defeated him. 
  Morpheous was deeply saddened by the destruction of his high priest, but
  imagine his horror when he went to claim the body, and saw that a wound  
  that could only have come from the blade of his own godly brother! He
  wept, my brethren. Morpheous disappeared from view with the sorry
  remains of our leader. I do not know what will happen now, but the
  skies seem to be holding their breaths. Pray, my brethren.

                                In Yr. Service
                                Elythaz, Cardinal of Templace-that-was ~
extradesc: section5
These pages of the book face a painting, beautifully rendered, of 
some sort of aerial explosion on a scale unimaginable to mortal eyes.
The text, written in a spidery script, reads:

  My brethren, there is again peace in our land, but at such a cost I
  hesitate to relay the story to you, for fear you will think I have
  taken leave of my senses.

  The All-Father himself, Metamorpho, appeared out of swirling mists
  when the city of Templace was destroyed. He was burning with the most
  holy wrath one can imagine, as terrible as an army with banners. He
  took up Morpheus, Blackmourne, and Angus, and all was quiet, save for
  the cries of the wounded. I tried my best to heal whom I could, but my
  strength was nearly gone. Like everybody on the field -- demon, human,
  and victim alike -- I carefully watched for the gods' return.

  When they did return, our gracious lord Morpheous, still holding the
  broken body of our Girr'Kaaz, performed a rite none have ever seen.
  Elia was furious that she could not perform the funeral rites, but
  she loves Morpheous as much as a human heart can love a god, so she
  allowed Morpheous to set his binding upon the world. The sky sparkled
  both with the power of the enchantment, and with the presence of many
  other gods, some of whom were newborn, some old and dear presences.
  They put their seal upon the ceremony. When it was over, Girr'Kaaz's 
  body turned to a kind of faerie-light that scattered all over the
  world. I write you only what I have seen, brethren.

  The gods did disappear just afterward, though I think Morpheous gazed
  upon the battlefield a short while. The Kaaz clan, what was left of it,
  scattered as well. I have not seen any of them since the battle.

  So that is where we are now, my brethren. Our mission is to rebuild
  this sorely shattered world and finish erasing the evils brought here
  by those whose greed nearly shattered everything we hold dear. If you
  happen to meet one of the Kaaz, do not alarm them, but report their
  movements to the Guild. I pray for their mental healing.

                          In Yr. Service,
                          Ausentharn, A Priest of the Northlands~

The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time itself --
that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater than any the world has
ever known, true love and blackest hatred, friendship and betrayal..  All
couched in the language of ancient times to form a manual of behavior for
magicians in the aftermath of a war the likes of which may never be seen
again...  Though the majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out
or damaged, enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.~
extradesc: cover
The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.~
extradesc: page3
This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small
caption near the bottom of the page reads "NAU I S". That is all you
can tell for sure.~

A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.~

Only its nearly translucent shadow gives an indication that this mantle is not
just a figment of the imagination.  Lightweight but not quite weightless, it
has clear strings at one end that indicate it could be tied around the
shoulders and worn as a mantle.  One end is even slightly weighted, making it
fall gracefully into artistic folds, barely visible.    ~

A hard, round shell which feels almost chitinous emits a soft golden light and
a warm feeling, though there is no actual heat coming from it.  It is about the
size of an ogre's clenched fist and is heavy but feels hollow rather than
solid.~

extradesc: harness-master bodysuit body-suit straps-leather
Easily worn under a robe or a cloak, this harness looks more like a fetishist's
personal clothing than armor.  The entire suit is inscribed with scriptures,
giving it a sort of holy torture that allows the wearer to clear their mind of
all but themselves.  By transcending the limits of the body, the monk becomes
one with the mind and the greater universe around them.~

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.~

When placed over the eyes, this extra set of eyes seems to focus one's vision
more, lending detail to even the most plain-seeming objects.  They float in
place magically, synchronizing perfectly with the eyes they are worn over.  
Seems a little odd, but they do help.~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short

The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow.  Gazing into
its crystalline depths, there seems to be insubstantial forms floating within
it.  Before you can decide what lies within, you are forced to look away, lest
its light blinds you.~

This bracelet is made out of a very durable weaved grass that has several
spaced out snake fangs weaved into it.  The fangs are about an inch in length
and give the bracelet a menacing look.  The grass is a dull green color and it
is weaved tightly so it looks almost like it is one piece of grass.~

no apparent straps used to leash it to your face.  It seems that the smoke is
wrapping around your hands as if to hold on, so it might do the same for your

There seems to be a subtle difference between what you see and how you remember

The bronze staff in your hands is huge-- it's almost too large to hold
effectively.  It pulses with power, its gemstone decorations lit as if from
some inner radiance.  A crystal on its tip sparkles with light.  Your hands
tingle at contact with it.  You wonder what it does.~

Where many tools dedicated to demonic forces are heavily detailed with runes
and symbols indicating their dark purpose and their masters, this dagger has
none of those traditional trappings.  A dagger made of blackened steel, sharp
yet unrefined, produced for one purpose only: to shed blood in the name of
Demon Lords.  On it is a single eye, a symbol of Yeenoghu, the Beast of
Butchery, so he may watch every kill up close.~

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.~

This is a splinter of steel in an elongated triangle.  The long edge is sharp,
though it might be handled with some care.  Embossed decoration and the
peculiar way the metal curves away from the edge seem reminiscent of the fine
longswords sometimes worn by the paladins of Sacred Haven.~

surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.~

Constructed from a large bough of an evergreen tree, twisted back upon itself
into a large circle, this wreath smells with the wondrous winter scent of
Christmas.  Various pine cones and berries are tied into the wreath, and a
large red bow on one side adds a vibrant splash of color to the decoration.  
The hole in the center is fairly wide, probably large enough to fit over your

Garlic is said to be able to ward off vampires.  It certainly will ward off
your friends if you eat too much of it, as it can cause very bad breath.  It
is, however, excellent at curing minor illnesses such as the common cold.  ~

plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.    ~

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

The iridescent sword gleams in the light, almost like its giving off some light
of its own.  The brilliant Damascus forged two sided blade is split down the
middle with a blood groove, from tip to shoulder.  The handle of the sword is

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.~

deep wisdom.    ~
