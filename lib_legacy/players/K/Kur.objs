melting in heat.  The plate is much thinner than steel, not even as thick as
most swords.  A series of leather straps on the back may be tied together to
hold the breastplate on.

A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a
grip, indicating that it could be used as a weapon.  Whether or not it would be
a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.

extradesc: snowflake lone earring snowflake-earring
It seems to be a snowflake set onto a tiny silver post.  The six-pointed flake
is cool to the touch, though it does not melt.  Whatever crystal substance it
is made of catches the light quite well, giving it an ever-present sparkle.  
Its miniscule arms have hexagonal symmetry, and it is very detailed.

extradesc: tights purple purple-tights snug-fitting pair rolled ball discarded
These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit! A tie-waist secures
them at the waist, and the thick woolen material goes from there all the
way down to your feet. They look quite old, and seem to glow with some
kind of magical power. Perhaps they're enchanted!

extradesc: skin armor dragon-skin dragon-armor
Of all things, dragon skin is incredibly rare.  The scales are hard and a dark
black color.  Each scale is the size of man's kneecap, connected from
underneath solidly.

extradesc: sleet-visor semicircle-thin-white-metal
This thin visor is cast from a mysterious white metal.  Apparently stronger
than steel, despite its thinness, it is almost impossible to deform.  A strap
hanging around the back allows the visor to be worn on the head to protect the
face.  Several vertical slits give the wearer a clear view of the surroundings.

extradesc: sleet-guard small-diamond-shaped-shield diamond-shield
Displaying an elaborate elven crest on its front, this sleet-white shield is
only as wide as a forearm is long, but used effectively could provide decent
protection.  The metal of the guard is fantastically thin, yet seems as strong
as, if not stronger than, well-tempered steel.    
~
extradesc: elven-crest
The elaborate elven crest is painted on the front of the sleet shield with
amazing detail.  It depicts a great lynx running on a blue background, with a
waving banner above it.  Some ancient elven runes are written across the
banner, but below the crest, the name Shiran appears in common script.

extradesc: hatchet battle axe
This cruel implement looks to be forged from iron, though crudely.  It has a
short shaft to which is attached the iron head.  A long "chin" extends downward
a ways to give it a longer cutting edge, and it is rather heavy.  Given the
chips and scratches, it has been used as much as a club as a slashing weapon.
