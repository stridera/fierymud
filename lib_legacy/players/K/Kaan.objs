This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside
of the ball cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small
sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to

bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel,

stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

9th day of the Month of Discovery, 352

   If your reading this, well, the plans didn't go off correctly.  I wanted a
legacy to carry on.  This tower was to be it.  In my days, I saw many places,
full of traps and treachery, but also of wealth and other spoils.  I strived to
leave such a place myself.  Alas, I plan on destroying these notes when it is
done, thus if you are reading this, the tower is not.  As I write this, the
enchanted tower has been completed ; a grand four stories tall.  It's too bad I
will be destroying part of it soon.  . .
 
  Work will not be finished for months, I fear, and with my ailing health, I
may not live to see it done.  I've called upon many favors - I'm afraid even my
soul will be the cost in the end.  So far, there's not much loot in here, most
has been sold for the protectors of the castle.  Sweet irony.    

   In the end, I have turned to demons to protect the lair, and slave labor to
build it.  What have I become.  Perhaps this is what is truly killing me.  Tis
only luck that the blue dragon has made the tower his perch.  What would it
cost for such a guardian?    

The writing continues in part2, part3, part4, part5, part6, part7
~
extradesc: part2
   First, I ask myself, why am I building this tower?  I have adventured for
many years, and have always been fascinated by places I had gone, both in the
architecture, and the secrets held within.  I have decided to leave a legacy
behind me.  Someone has to die for a tomb to be looted.    

   Alas, with a life of adventure came a life with no heirs, so my money is
worthless after I die anyhow.  I am still in good health now, but getting older
every day.  Thus, my life's goal.    

   I have enlisted a few of my more mystical friends for the construction.  
This shall be no ordinary tower, by any means.  For one, we have concocted an
enchantment for the stone of the tower, such that it shall rebuild itself if
e'er it gets destroyed.  The bits of stone are attacted to one another, such
that no matter the distance, they will slowly be pulled together again.  Yea,
it may take millenia if they are far apart, but the tower shall never be
destroyed.    
~
extradesc: part3
   This was quite costly, but I believe it will be a good investment in the
long run.  No matter what happens, the tower will never quite die.    
 
   The basement has been created.  We decided upon an infinite hallway to
protect my study.  It too wasn't terribly hard to create, merely a modified
dimension door spell.  I had to give up my grandmother's broach, though, to get
the work done.  My friends are quite stingy, they are.    

   Finding workers from an area far enough away that they won't be able to find
their way back was quite tough.  The southern continent was a good choice.  To
get back without help, they'd have to raft the blue fog sea.  I've ne'er seen a
bigger ship down there in my days.  Getting them back there will be tougher.  
Our ride got called off to tend to her father, dying of old age. 
~
extradesc: part4
   Had the druid community not severed ties with me after the unfortunate
incident in the forest...  I hadn't honestly meant to hurt anything, especially
not the animals, and how was I to know that the owl was a shapechanger...  
Life would be much easier. 

   We just had a few incidents in the construction.  The sub basement floor
collapsed.  It turns out a giant worm has burrowed under the tower.  It turns
out to have some intelligence, I think.  I... agreed to keep it fed if it
did no damage.  I didn't realize how much it eats.  We may need to exterminate
it.    

   Some fool put a door on the second floor of the tower to the outside.  
Unfortunately, they're nothing outside of it.  I've locked it to avoid any more
accidents.  Two deaths were bad enough.  Perhaps they would have survived, but
evidently the door happened to lead right above where the worm had burrowed,
thus the pit was quite deep.    
~
extradesc: part5
   Part of our labor force has decided to abandon the project.  A few of
them...  Were threatening to break their vow.  I had to put them down.  I think
the rest will understand the graveness of the situation, and will realize the
penalties for betraying me.    

   The work force has mutinied.  After hearing tales of what I did to those
that left, they snuck out after I offered them a two day break.  I will track
them down one by one and punish them all.  Traitors.  First, though, I must
find a replacement work force...  Work most continue - the tower must be
completed I have taken ill as of late, quite severely.  I hope it will pass,
but I must press on in case it does not.  I am ...  Seeking connections at the
moment.    

   I have sought an audience with the Demon Lord Krisenna.  We have struck a
deal; he seems quite benevolent at the moment.  Hopefully it will stay that
way.  The deal works in both our favors.  They provide the workers and
protection, and I provide them with a safe entry way into our world.  They have
finished the external tower, and have retreated into the bowels to finish up.

   I have allowed them free reign to create themselves a sealed off passageway
to keep anyone who might make their way in from getting to them.  I am not even
allowed to see what they are doing there, lest I bother them, or give others
knowledge of how to do the same thing.

extradesc: part7
   I have just stumbled back across this book, and it weighs heavily on my
mind.  I have seen my soul blacken over time.  Alas, I think it is too late for
me.  They have taken almost all of my goods as tribute, and they have an iron
grip on the tower.  I plot, hoping to find a way to get rid of them, but I fear
the deal is done.

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.

stone, opaque and milky-white.  There is no sign of what the stone signifies.

handle is silver with a worn, white leather grip and the head of the goremaul
is inlaid with orichalcum, a rare alloy of gold that is said to be especially
effective against evil creatures.  The weapon hums slightly with a not
unpleasant buzz, constantly reminding someone that it is there.  At the base of
the grip is a holy symbol.

Title: The Lost Library of Shiran
Author: Karlix the Omniscient

"...and a great civilization rose and prospered.  They achieved such
wealth and status and they did not want the knowledge they had gathered
and strove for to be lost to succeeding generations.  So they built a great
library on an island off the coast of their great city.  Into this library
they placed all the knowledge they had gathered over the centuries.  Great
tomes about life, mythical creatures, far away and mythical lands, great
items of magic, etc, etc.  Such was the knowledge that they possessed that
it is rumored the gods got jealous and deemed the information kept in that
library too great for mortal minds.  And so, it is rumored it was the
gods who destroyed the Library and with it all the knowledge kept
therein..."

The doll is a horrid looking thing: it's little, greenish, and looks like the
blob.  Under the globs of gelatinous gleaming gunk, glint the green eyes of a
gooey effigy.  Its original visage is difficult to make out, because of all the
green gelatin caked on it.  The goo is quite sticky, causing anything touching
it to become lodged in the mess.

   These pants are made out of a satiny material that feels soft and smooth,
cold on the outside but comfortable when worn.  Large pockets should have
enough room in them for as many oddments as one could desire, and a thin
drawstring at the wait insures that they should fit anyone.  Given their
shimmering appearance and comfortable fit, it is almost certain they are
magical in nature.

Though it looks like metal, this ring is actually made out of the lustrous
stone hematite.  It is slightly more brittle than a metal ring and very cool to
the touch.  It looks like it would fit a slender finger better than a thick one
- it would be a shame to have such a nice ring shatter.

     Someone had to have paid thousands of gold pieces for such a spectacular
piece of artwork - yet this wondrous little figurine came from within an
actual bird's egg!  Accurate down to the smallest detail, this heavy metal
statuette of a cockatiel is encrusted with jewels of all sorts: dark brown
faceted tourmaline stares back as the bird's eyes, small citrines and rubies
create the distinctive orange cheek patches, and smoky quartz and clear
diamonds make up the feathers.

gooey effigy.  Its original visage is difficult to make out, because of all the
green gelatin caked on it.  The goo is quite sticky, causing anything touching
it to become lodged in the mess.

     These fine pants are made of a light fabric to which are sewn hundreds of
soft feathers.  The plumage looks to have come from all sorts of birds, with
long blue and green feathers likely from parrots lined up beside the smaller
browns, whites,  and greys of birds like finches and budgerigars.  Though their
value as armor might be questionable, the breeches do look to be rather warm
and even comfortable - and a must-have for every dandy's wardrobe!

Twinkling in the light like a halo of blue fire, the sapphires on this bracelet
are linked together by a thin chain of beautifully polished silver.  Each
sapphire is mounted in a small silver rectangle, following the chain around in
a circle.  The sapphire quality is exquisite, flawlessly reflecting a brilliant
bright blue color.

     About as big around as your fist, the smooth off-white surface of this egg
is speckled with tiny flecks of blue and yellow, giving it an almost marbled
appearance.  The egg is warm in your hand, and you can almost feel the beating
of a tiny heart inside it.  Perhaps if kept properly warm and cared for, in a
few days the most wonderful of treasures might be discovered inside.

These finely ground lenses must be gnomish work, for they seem to be flawless.
The rims are a thin silver and the nosepiece seems quite comfortable.  They
would surely be a great help to someone who has no near-vision that wants to
read a book or crochet or do anything else that requires them to see things
close up.

red in color; the handle of the dagger itself, however, is surprisingly cool.
