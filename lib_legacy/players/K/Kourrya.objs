extradesc: ring soul gem valuable soul-gem wof-clan-item
   A large purple gem is set on a polished silver band.  There appears to be a
small storm raging inside of the gem, and you become slightly transfixed by it.
A feeling of protectiveness washes over you, and you feel that losing this ring
would be the end of your life.

Made of thin black cotton, this kimono blends in perfectly with the shadows of
night.  Silk would provide a telltale sheen, though it would also be lighter,
but the black-dyed cotton absorbs light rather than reflecting it.  It is
utterly silent, not even giving the usual "whoosh" of fabric when moved.  The
sleeves fall only to the elbows, providing plenty of room to swing a weapon.

extradesc: hairpiece hair piece dragon carved ivory jade miniature lisminis-hairpiece
Upon closer inspection, this dragon carving reveals a long silver pin that
looks like it could be used to style hair in quite a striking manner.  Two
dragons, one each of ivory and jade, twirl around each other with artistically
elongated bodies and catfish-like whiskers, looking both fierce and wise.  
Such a hairpiece is surely the height of fashion.

extradesc: memento lover's lovers lovers-soul soul locket platinum
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.

   The bracelet is formed from small beads of gold and grayish colored stones.
It is very old and shows the marks from years of use.  The stone beads are
cracked and worn down on the edges and a few of them have chipped apart.  The
gold beads are starting to tarnish and fade, almost matching the dull luster of
the stone, from prolonged contact with the sweat from the skin.
