extradesc: nasty jagged fiery greaves chaotic
Faint black flame surrounds these greaves, though they leave no burns when
touched.  Combine that with the sharp, jagged points along the edges, these
greaves appear to have come straight from some underworld realm.  Probably made
of enchanted onyx or obsidian, these greaves are excellent armor for a dark
warrior.
