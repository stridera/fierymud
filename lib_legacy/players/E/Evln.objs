When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed
hastily with clumsy hands. The teeth vary in shape and size making you
wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

extradesc: speckled egg
     About as big around as your fist, the smooth off-white surface of this egg
is speckled with tiny flecks of blue and yellow, giving it an almost marbled
appearance.  The egg is warm in your hand, and you can almost feel the beating
of a tiny heart inside it.  Perhaps if kept properly warm and cared for, in a
few days the most wonderful of treasures might be discovered inside.

Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.
