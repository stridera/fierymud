  The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand. It seems to light up
the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

extradesc: studded leather tunic assassin
It is hard to discern the edges of this tunic, for they fade and shift from
sight, as if actively avoiding detection.  While apparently made from
black, studded leather, the tunic is lighter than most cloth and can be violently
shaken without making a sound.  Tunics of this kind are often presented to
high-ranking rogue guild members and are not given away lightly.

Made out of pure shadow, a hood like this allows the wearer to do more than
hide; they gain the senses of the shadows themselves.  Prized by rogues and
assassins alike, a hood like this is rarely found, but given to a person who
has advanced to the highest ranks in their guild.

These sleeves flow like velvet but have the weight of a lighter fabric.  They

Magic was clearly involved in their creation for no normal fabric offers these

extradesc: platinum gauntlets templar
Platinum plates fit together to form these secure but mobile gauntlets.  Each
gauntlet is etched with numerous angelic and celestial runes, filling them with
powerful holy magic.  Almost completely smooth in finish, the gauntlets almost
appear to be fashioned from the hide of the legendary couatl.

The coral necklace is made up of a variety of different pieces of coral.
This coral is brightly colored; whether the coral's coloration is natural
or the result of pigments applied by the savages, you are unsure of. In
any event, it is a very pretty piece of jewelry.

Kwan Yin came from the sea, and that is probably where this stunning

pearl! It has a faint glow, from the pearl itself, it seems. You will
cherish it forever, just knowing that it once touched and adorned the

don't give much protection, they do allow for an unrestricted range of motion,
as well as a sleek look.

   A single stalk of dill, complete with a fist sized umbrel of yellow-green
flowers, grows in a small earthen pot.  Basking in the unnatural glow of the
room has benefitted the plant, which has a strong aroma.  The stalk seems to be
in good condition, nearly ready for harvesting of its oil.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

The vest is comprised of interlocked star-shaped pieces of metal
sewn to a thick vest of leather. The concept seems similar to that
of ringmail, at least to the untrained eye. You imagine that this
vest might be slightly tougher than your average ringmail, although
it does not appear to be magical in any way.

As you look at the tapestry, your spirit rises from the sublime 
colors and expert weaving of the piece, then falls, as you notice how 
ragged its edges are, and how obviously neglected it is. There's no way 
it can be repaired, you see. That's too bad. If it were in better shape, 
it'd be worthy of a lord's castle. You might even want to put it in 
yours, if you ever get one.
