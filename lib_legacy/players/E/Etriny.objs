   The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow. Gazing

floating within it. Before you can decide what lies within, you are

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes 
are strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads. Here and there 
little strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form 
interesting geometric designs. This necklace is a charm from the 
Wizardess Thekra; you recognize it at once.

Some of the pages seem to be marked, in particular page16 and page37
which talk about future directions for more powerful spellcasters and
how to encode a simple cipher respectively.

The preface briefly states how essential it is for a spellcaster to
protect his spells against accidental or deliberate theft, by encoding
them.
~
extradesc: page16
A passage has been circled on this page, it reads:
    ...so in order to ensure that the magic user has a copious supply of
willing subjects for his experiments, he must first ingratiate himself with
his chosen town by generous acts. An intelligent mage will try and get
himself accepted into the council, and perhaps even move for a law which can
be used to aid him. This could state that all mad people be locked up, or
all criminals be killed. We all know how easy it is to turn a mind to madness
and the mage may then take these subjects 'under his protection' and
experiment on them without worry, as the populace soon forget what has
happened to them...

There is also a note in the margin which seems to be a calculation of some
sort and a reference to page23.
~
extradesc: page23
Ack, its a recipe for unlimited power, but it involves several unsavoury
ingredients including human organs. A passage has been circled on this page
too, and it reads:
    ...obviously in order to get this many human hearts is impossible
which is why this spell still remains theoretical, although if one were
to perfect some sort of cloning technique, coupled with a spell for creation
of a human, then it might be possible to create a human with many vestigial
organs which would presumably still be valid for the recipe...

Your skin crawls as you continue to read, anyone who really thought this
sort of stuff would work would have to be mad right?
~
extradesc: page37
There are some simple ciphers on the page here, and some notes in the margin
which look like the would have continued onto page 38, only that page has
been torn out of the book! You read the notes anyway and puzzle over the
missing data:
    ...and as has been known through history the simplest cipher is a
substitution whereby one letter is substituted for another (for example
the next letter in the alphabet) and the message is rewritten. The decoder
knows that the letters are shifted by a certain number of positions and
can easily decode the message. This is known as a monoalphabetic cipher. A
more complex 'polyalphabetic' cipher such as the Vigenere cipher may also
be used. The illustration on the next page shows this in action, but basically
the implementation is as follows:
     1) the keyword is chosen and repeatedly written below the phrase to be encoded
     2) the combination of keyword letter and phrase letter are used to index  the Vigenere tableau
     3) the indexed letters form the encoded phrase
And the decryption works in reverse, going down the column indexed by the
keyword letter to the encoded letter, and determining which letter heads that
row. Obviously a keyword of all 'a' would not encrypt at all.
The page ends here!

extradesc: gnome gnomes gnome's thigh thighbone bone
This bone is under a foot long, and clearly comes from the leg of an
unfortunate gnome.  It's highly polished, as if it were extensively handled.  
An inscription, apparently burned into the surface of the bone, starts near the
middle and spirals toward the thick end.  Its language is unknown to you.

This tambourine is made of two wooden discs pegged together. Through
the gaps in between them, someone has thrust pairs of small brass
circles. The slightest movement makes the circles jingle together,
producing a wild, mysterious cacophony.

This little silver charm is the God of the Moonless Night's gift to his
clerics, to keep them safe and identify them as Lokari's to anyone who
might inquire as to their status. It's just a silver crescent-moon shape.

extradesc: snowflake lone earring snowflake-earring
It seems to be a snowflake set onto a tiny silver post.  The six-pointed flake
is cool to the touch, though it does not melt.  Whatever crystal substance it
is made of catches the light quite well, giving it an ever-present sparkle.  
Its miniscule arms have hexagonal symmetry, and it is very detailed.

extradesc: pendant ice crystal hexagonal hexagon ice-crystal-pendant
   A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.

Kwan Yin's love of the sea is obvious in this exquisite ring's
workmanship. The body of the ring is sea-silver, almost blue with memory
of the ocean. One absolutely stunning pearl adorns the ring, with deep
blue sapphires running otter-swift around the pearl.~
