This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside
of the ball cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small
sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

A broad band of silver, the legendary ring of Krystophus appears quite ordinary
save for a some runic engravings that run the course of the ring.  The ring
itself is rather warm and fills your head with a strange, accelerated sensation
and low humming as you touch it.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at

Hi Elron,
Glad you like the new tunnels!  I already withdrew the 12k plati@0num
from KotF's coffers *whistle*.  You can convince Suraki to deposit
that amount in the clan treasury if you'd like to keep the clan funds
high.  Hope you have a great time at dinner!

One glance at this weapon is enough to tell you that it has been 
powerfully enchanted. Black runes run the length of the sword, and a 
dull white flame surrounds the blade. The blade itself has an odd purple 
hue.
