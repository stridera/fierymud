About thirty small bone rings are roughly connected together to form a piece of
decoration.  It looks as though it may offer you a little protection though.

Gross!  This armor appears to me made of small circles of bone.  It seems
rather protective though.

extradesc: leather boots
These work boots are made of dark brown leather. They go about calf-high,
and though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled
along its edges. They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable
for anybody wanting some basic protection.

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.
