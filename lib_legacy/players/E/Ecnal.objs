   The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is
both too bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.

extradesc: ring emerald
This ring is made of solid gold with a large emerald set in the middle.  The
jem is so bright it almost blinds you to look at it.  The dark monks could
never afford a ring like this, they must have swiped it from a local jewelry
store.  As you look inside the ring you see a small inscription that probably
tells you who owned it.

Just looking at these sandals makes you feel more capable of

leather-covered footbed; the straps crisscross over the ankles
and up the calves. The leather is thick, and a kind of magical
aura around the sandals makes them blur out of sight a little.

This is a pair of fine goggles, made of expertly tanned leather and lenses of
thick glass.  Excellent for protecting the eyes from the loose dust and
occasional hazards in a mine, they would probably also be useful outdoors in a
sandstorm, though underwater use would probably ruin the leather and is not
recommended.

Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food
make this area a haven for all sorts of creatures of the forest.

   The fur cloak is not very comfortable to wear but if it can protect you

This action figure appears to be an exact replica of Dakhod!  With a peg leg
and a hook for a hand, the attention to detail is stunning.  This action figure
comes complete with karate chop action when its legs are squeezed, and a
pullstring on his back.
