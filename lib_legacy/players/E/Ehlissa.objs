It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes 
are strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads. Here and there 
little strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form 
interesting geometric designs. This necklace is a charm from the 
Wizardess Thekra; you recognize it at once.

   These pants are made out of a satiny material that feels soft and smooth,
cold on the outside but comfortable when worn.  Large pockets should have
enough room in them for as many oddments as one could desire, and a thin
drawstring at the wait insures that they should fit anyone.  Given their
shimmering appearance and comfortable fit, it is almost certain they are
magical in nature.

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

blob.  Under the globs of gelatinous gleaming gunk, glint the green eyes of a
gooey effigy.  Its original visage is difficult to make out, because of all the
green gelatin caked on it.  The goo is quite sticky, causing anything touching
it to become lodged in the mess.

appearance comes from the ring itself, and would probably serve to warm the
finger it is worn on.
