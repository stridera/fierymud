This is the Cailaran Vest, which you've heard of in stories, seen in 
tapestries and paintings, even idly imagined seeking (and finding). It's 
a long green vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and 
flowing to the calves. The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in 
golden thread in a criss-cross pattern. The double-breasted collar is 
embroidered as well, in golden four-pointed stars. It'd look perfect with 
a silk blouse and breeches.

This lone horn is very large and curved.  It is cracked and broken in two
places: a large break marks the spot where it was wrenched from the mighty
demon Krisenna's head, and a smaller break is higher up.  The smaller end is
worn, as if the horns were smoothed after the injury.  Whether this was done in
battle or for vanity is impossible to tell.  Some power remains in the horn,
damaged as it is.

These leggings are precisely manufactured of tightly bound fish scales,

the sea and of the merfolk that inhabit its depths.  Perhaps there is more to
these seeming fish scales than meets the eye...

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.

barbs at the head to cause ripping damage along with the usual bludgeon.  Its
handle is silver with a worn, white leather grip and the head of the goremaul
is inlaid with orichalcum, a rare alloy of gold that is said to be especially
effective against evil creatures.  The weapon hums slightly with a not
unpleasant buzz, constantly reminding someone that it is there.  At the base of
the grip is a holy symbol.
