They are finely tailored of regular coarse linen and dyed black.
With their close-fitting form, they certainly cut a nice figure
beneath a robe.

extradesc: feather quill
The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!
     (Hint : you need something to write on...then
      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)
