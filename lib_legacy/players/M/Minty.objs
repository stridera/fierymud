extradesc: dragon fist mace broken
You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by 
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far 
from here. It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much 
lighter, lucky for you! The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's 
slightly clenched clawed forefoot. But it's fallen on hard times--its 
handle is broken, and its surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft 
and balance. It's still quite usable, though no experienced warrior 
would be interested in wielding it, since its power is greatly reduced 
because of its condition. But a junior trainee would be thrilled to have 
this once-impressive weapon.

What's that strange grey creature under the zipper?  Why does it looks so
insane?  Why is it making me talk really fast and in a high-pitched voice and
making me ask all these questions?  I DON'T KNOW!  (A little button on the
bottom makes the doll light up if you press it).

The long wooden oval frames support your feet on interlaced thongs, and 
strap on by way of leather buckles. They don't look very impressive, but 
they sure do look effective in helping you traverse the killingly cold 
snow of the arctic fields -- and they might protect you a little bit too.
