This finely woven cloak is made of pure white satin with cotton embroidery
marking out an abstract bird symbol on the back which, though it is also in
white, shows up in string light due to the difference in luster between the two
fabrics.  Long ties at the neck can be used to fasten the cloak against the
chill winds of the north.  It looks like it would also make great camoflauge in

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

extradesc: emblazoned-baldric large-ornamented-belt leather
This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.~

This wristband is metal, but somehow slightly stretchy, almost elastic.  Its

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~
