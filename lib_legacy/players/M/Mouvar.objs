The coral ring seems totally flawless.  It is made of the finest coral you have
ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white on the other.  It
is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance so that it is not the
least bit abrasive.~

This small mushroom is certainly one of a kind.  Its green stem and yellow cap,
give this mushroom a very strange look.  Although it appears to be quite
extra-ordinary, it is very edible.    ~

extradesc: book
The worn out leather book binding is almost falling apart.  It is very old
and the leather is well oiled from being handed by unclean hands.  The pages in
the book are hand written with a variety of inks giving light to the idea that
the pages were written on different days as if a journal would be.  You can
read a few of the first pages: page1, page2 and page3.~
extradesc: page3
For all that are powerful
Bringing fists down on the weak
Smashing their souls
And breaking the meek

May they soon meet their maker
Brought forth for their misdeed
Wrought down into the ground
Stomped flat their greed

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence 
Then let us to ascend~
extradesc: page1
   The quaint sounds of spring fill my ears with a joy not found else where.  
The breeze showers my skin with the sensations of the air.  This feeling
empowers me with the creativity that is unrivaled by others.  Like floating on
top of the world without the weight of gravity to pull me down.    ~

............THOUGHTS............
   Thoughts drain like water
  Down into the consciousness 
   Collected in a small form
Then spread out to be recollected 
  Rearranged and transformed 
Until they collide with perfection 
     Forming what would be
          What could be
 The greatest thought of them all~

extradesc: trinket leather tattered
   The small scrap of leather has been worn beyond belief.  Its edges are
frayed and it is very soft to the touch.  There is a very small portion of a
picture that is crafted onto it, lending to the certainty that it is from a
larger piece of artwork.  Judging from the condition of the leather, this has
been around a long time, and held regularly as someone's good luck trinket.  ~

This kind of trumpet is traditionally used for heraldry to announce the coming
of knights or kings.  While well cared for, it bears clear signs of regular
use.  If it could speak, what stories of nobility and honor would it tell?~

Brought forth for their misdeed
Wrought down into the ground
Stomped flat their greed

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence 
Then let us to ascend~

   The quaint sounds of spring fill my ears with a joy not found else where.  
The breeze showers my skin with the sensations of the air.  This feeling
empowers me with the creativity that is unrivaled by others.  Like floating on
top of the world without the weight of gravity to pull me down.    ~

............THOUGHTS............
   Thoughts drain like water
  Down into the consciousness 
   Collected in a small form
Then spread out to be recollected 
  Rearranged and transformed 
Until they collide with perfection 
     Forming what would be
          What could be
 The greatest thought of them all~

extradesc: bracelet bracelet-consecrated-spirit small-bracelet-stone-gold-beads
The bracelet is formed from small beads of gold and grayish colored stones.  
It is very old and shows the marks from years of use.  The stone beads are
cracked and worn down on the edges and a few of them have chipped apart.  The
gold beads are starting to tarnish and fade, almost matching the dull luster of
the stone, from prolonged contact with the sweat from the skin.~

into a large circle, this wreath smells with the wondrous winter scent of
Christmas.  Various pine cones and berries are tied into the wreath, and a
large red bow on one side adds a vibrant splash of color to the decoration.  
The hole in the center is fairly wide, probably large enough to fit over your
