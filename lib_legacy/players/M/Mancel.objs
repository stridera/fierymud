If it weren't for its bright red color, this precious splinter would go
unnoticed because of its tiny size.  However, as soon as it is picked up it
begins to emit a magical light.  It has clearly been enchanted.

Title: The Lost Library of Shiran
Author: Karlix the Omniscient

"...and a great civilization rose and prospered.  They achieved such
wealth and status and they did not want the knowledge they had gathered
and strove for to be lost to succeeding generations.  So they built a great
library on an island off the coast of their great city.  Into this library
they placed all the knowledge they had gathered over the centuries.  Great
tomes about life, mythical creatures, far away and mythical lands, great
items of magic, etc, etc.  Such was the knowledge that they possessed that
it is rumored the gods got jealous and deemed the information kept in that
library too great for mortal minds.  And so, it is rumored it was the
gods who destroyed the Library and with it all the knowledge kept
therein..."

This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.

Made of thin black cotton, this kimono blends in perfectly with the shadows of
night.  Silk would provide a telltale sheen, though it would also be lighter,
but the black-dyed cotton absorbs light rather than reflecting it.  It is
utterly silent, not even giving the usual "whoosh" of fabric when moved.  The
sleeves fall only to the elbows, providing plenty of room to swing a weapon.

extradesc: head severed-lions-head chimera-head lion
Once golden-haired with a beautiful, rich brown mane, this lion's head is now
severed from its body, clotted blood matting the edges of its hair.  A terrible
expression of wrath and anguish is locked onto its face, hinting at its
agonizing downfall.  Much of the insides of the head have long fallen out,
leaving a hideously gross interior large enough to fit another head in.

The whisk is only as large as a woman's hand, and made of bamboo.  Several
pieces of light bamboo have been woven together at the handle, their ends
allowed to fray to form a whisk. It's lightweight, and its whorled strands
of bamboo would make it an excellent whisk for the powdered tea of the tea
ceremony of Odaishyozen.~

Constructed from a large bough of an evergreen tree, twisted back upon
itself into a large circle, this wreath smells with the wonderous winter
scent of Christmas.  Various pine cones and berries are tied into the
wreath, and a large red bow on one side adds a vibrant splash of color
to the decoration.  The hole in the center is fairly wide, probably
large enough to fit over your head...
