with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

of a tiny heart inside it.  Perhaps if kept properly warm and cared for, in a
few days the most wonderful of treasures might be discovered inside.~

Someone had to have paid thousands of gold pieces for such a spectacular piece
of artwork - yet this wondrous little figurine came from within an actual
bird's egg!  Accurate down to the smallest detail, this heavy metal statuette
of a cockatiel is encrusted with jewels of all sorts: dark brown faceted
tourmaline stares back as the bird's eyes, small citrines and rubies create the
distinctive orange cheek patches, and smoky quartz and clear diamonds make up
the feathers.~

the aviary picking away at the tiny but tasty seeds well into the evening
