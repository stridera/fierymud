extradesc: robe neatly-folded-cotton-robe light-cotton-robe yukata
This light blue robe is decorated with a feather pattern, identifying it as
belonging to the Phoenix Feather Resort west of Ickle.  The style is familiar
to anyone who knows the customs of Odaishyozen: it's meant to be worn in the
same way as a kimono.  Because it's made of cotton rather than silk and
designed for more casual wear, this style of robe is called a yukata.  It was
probably designed by someone from the resort who visited the Emerald Isle.

You watch in amazement as flickering tongues of flame race up and down

red in color; the handle of the dagger itself, however, is surprisingly cool.

This little stone flask is a perfect sculpture of a stony golem, save the
little stopper protruding from the top of its head.  Its hollow stone eyes
chillingly reflect no emotions or remorse...  Though that would seem to be
normal from such an inanimate object as this.

This long staff is made of some sort of dark wood that tapers from the

length are wrapped in leather strips, though the rest of it is covered
in a regular arrangement of thick thorns. The bulbous top of the staff
is covered in them. This weapon, for weapon it must be, has a good weight
and heft in the hand.

You see an old tattered piece of cloth.  It's very beaten up and has been

near you.  Something about this cloth makes you feel just a little bit more
knowledgeable.  You briefly wonder who first wove this old shawl.
