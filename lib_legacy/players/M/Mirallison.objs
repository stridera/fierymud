The coral ring seems totally flawless.  It is made of the finest coral you have
ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white on the other.  It
is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance so that it is not the
least bit abrasive.~

with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

Salt is one of the oldest and simplest spices known to man.  In some ancient
lands, soldiers were paid in salt.  It is used to preserve meat and usually
makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,
just sitting around.  It is the most common spice.    ~
