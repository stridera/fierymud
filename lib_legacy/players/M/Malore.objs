This plain metal band made of either silver or electrum holds a small dark blue
starstone gem.  Hundreds of thousands of tiny mineral deposits within it
reflect and refract light like stars twinkling in the dark, giving it its name.
Though starstone itself is not inherently magical, a ring like this almost
certainly is!~

silver teardrop is encircled with a thin copper wire and anchored to black
leather cord.  The tear is frigid to the touch and fills your mind with an

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes are
strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads.  Here and there little
strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form interesting
geometric designs.  This necklace is a charm from the Wizardess Thekra; you
recognize it at once.~

flecks of color subtly drift amongst the fabric, which shifts and flows as the
robe moves.  This is not just a representation of the night sky, but a

At first glance, these lenses don't seem to have much of a purpose.  A
prismatic chitinous stick hangs off one side like the handle on opera glasses
or a masquerade mask, yet the lenses still have arms to hold them in place
above the ears like spectacles The glass is of uneven thickness and shape, not
conforming to any specific geometry.  Only by holding them up to your eyes and
looking through them can you begin to see the subtle refraction of magical
energies the lenses detect.~
