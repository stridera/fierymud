This delicate golden feather is about as long as your forearm.  The long, lacy
fronds of the feather's plumage waft slightly in the breeze.  Oh, and it also
glows like the sun.  Just touching it makes your spirit soar!~

This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.    ~

foot was severed, and has been expertly, if not magically, preserved.  
Stitched together like shoes so as to allow anyone to wear them, the

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some

large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.~

extradesc: cloak tundra-cloak pile snowy-white-cloth
This finely woven cloak is made of pure white satin with cotton embroidery
marking out an abstract bird symbol on the back which, though it is also in
white, shows up in string light due to the difference in luster between the two
fabrics.  Long ties at the neck can be used to fasten the cloak against the
chill winds of the north.  It looks like it would also make great camoflauge in
the snow.~

Title: The Lost Library of Shiran
Author: Karlix the Omniscient

"...and a great civilization rose and prospered.  They achieved such
wealth and status and they did not want the knowledge they had gathered
and strove for to be lost to succeeding generations.  So they built a great
library on an island off the coast of their great city.  Into this library
they placed all the knowledge they had gathered over the centuries.  Great
tomes about life, mythical creatures, far away and mythical lands, great
items of magic, etc, etc.  Such was the knowledge that they possessed that
it is rumored the gods got jealous and deemed the information kept in that
library too great for mortal minds.  And so, it is rumored it was the
gods who destroyed the Library and with it all the knowledge kept
therein..."~

The staff appears to be engulfed in a blue flame, but it remains cool to

apparently some type of magical charm which may or may not have worn off
with the passage of time.~

ice it is a fairly unremarkable dagger.~
