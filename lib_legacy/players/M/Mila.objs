This is the ring of a god, granted to one who has shown great courage and
fortitude in retrieving items of certain value.  The Lord Tanle has, however
reserved the right to call on the wearer of this ring if and when it suits his
purpose, or may repossess the ring at any time.  The ring is a slender platinum
band of rare, incalculable value with a small, pink, white, blue, green, and
purple stone laid in the top.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

Merely a chip off a much larger dragonscale, this shard seems to have retained
much of the resilience of its previous owner.  Faint ridges run across the
shard's red surface, swirling and squiggling almost into recognizable images.
The shard of dragonscale is very warm to the touch, apparently maintaining some
of the heat from the dragon it once protected.  A tiny clip is attached to the
back of the shard, allowing it to be fastened to a cloak or tunic.  A small
dragon claw is etched into the clip.~

extradesc: greaves chaotic-greaves nasty-jagged-looking-fiery-greaves
Faint black flame surrounds these greaves, though they leave no burns when
touched.  Combine that with the sharp, jagged points along the edges, these
greaves appear to have come straight from some underworld realm.  Probably made
of enchanted onyx or obsidian, these greaves are excellent armor for a dark
warrior.~

This chestplate bares the image of a huge demonic face, pounded out in
bas-relief across the entire surface.  Forged from steel as burned as black as
night, then molded and dedicated to a particular evil entity, the wearer is
granted great unholy power, protecting them as they rain evil and chaos down on
the realms.~

This helm is forged from some Stygian-black metal that does not burn but
leeches the life out of the world around it.  From the side of the helm winds
two large horns, gleaming with a sinister life of their own.  Black flames burn
about the horns, showing their truly Infernal nature.~

You behold the legendary Stormcloak, once worn by the mighty Stormlord, Holder
of Tempests, himself.  The dark indigo cloth the cloak is made of scintillates,
giving the impression of thousands of tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into
its brocade surface.  It's quite heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held
together by a bronze clasp, beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon
whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you
look at it, touch it.~

extradesc: wings dragon-wings heap-silver-scales
A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.~

This shield is made of bright blue-white steel, but it glows with a faint pink
aura.  The design on the front is ancient and very familiar, though you can't
immediately place it for now.  And if you put your ear against its softly
thrumming surface, you can hear what seems to be a lullaby, in a strong female
voice touched with gentleness.~

You see an old tattered piece of cloth.  It's very beaten up and has been
through many generations of owners.  You can feel it's age as you bring it near
you.  Something about this cloth makes you feel just a little bit more
knowledgeable.  You briefly wonder who first wove this old shawl.~

The cloak seems to be jet black, and yet ...  Seems to be a swirling mass of
colour.  You touch it, and it feels neither cold nor warm to your touch, yet at
the same time, you get a strange sensation of burning and freezing.~
