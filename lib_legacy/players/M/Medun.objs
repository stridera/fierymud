extradesc: poem riddle
A special Valentine's game for you
To see if your heart is pure and true
Two items you'll need to finish the game
Two different ones, mind, not two of the same
The first is a pink rose of friendship and love
The next is a box with sweet treats from above
The rose can be found on ones who love true
A young Queen whose domain is really quite new
A man who loves one of royalty's blood
And a mother of pink on all fours with her brood
And do not forget the one who loves roses
And all other plants be they ravens or posies
The poem continues on part2.

~
extradesc: part2
For the box you will have to go farther afield
For one is on someone who holds a pink shield
The next two wear rings of eternal devotion
Though one is a Bride's and the other one broken
The last box is on a bird full of desire
His heart is too hot to touch; it's all fire
Once you have both you will know what to do
This riddle can only be finished with two
From what's in the box you should bring them to me
And perhaps a return of the prisoner you'll see

It seems to be a snowflake set onto a tiny silver post.  The six-pointed flake
is cool to the touch, though it does not melt.  Whatever crystal substance it
is made of catches the light quite well, giving it an ever-present sparkle.  
Its miniscule arms have hexagonal symmetry, and it is very detailed.

Wreathed in ever-burning flames, these gauntlets are horrible things indeed!  
Spiked protrusions cover the back of the hands, and the fingers reach out to
end in demonic, claw-like digits.  Hollow like a shell, but heavy like stone,
these gauntlets could well have been crafted from the carapace of some minor
devil or demon.

These boots are an anomaly, for they have been polished smooth and clean, but
they absorb all light and reflections, making them boots of palpable darkness.
The occasional warp or buckle appears randomly on the surface, almost like the

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically

in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....
