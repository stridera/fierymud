slightly curved and much thinner than average steel, undoubtedly created by
some uncomprehensible elven miracle.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

archetypical beast, combining intricately detailed scales, elaborate feathers,
and ridged horns along the temples.  Bold colors, reds, blues, greens, golds,
burst out of the design to emphasize power and strength.  The ink is infused
with the blood of the greatest beasts from all across Ethilien.  Infused with
such power, the tattoo causes the bearer's eyes to burn with a fierce inner
light, piercing the dark with fiery determination.~

Made of a hard mangrove wood dyed a deep blood-red by some unknown technique,
this mask shows a scowling troll, complete with horns and fangs and terrifying

bit of surrealism to the mask.  Both protective and useful, it glows with
magical energy.  This mask was surely crafted by a master.~

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.~

The shield has many dents in it but seems quite sturdy.  The surface of the

surely a mighty warrior who held these values in high esteem.~
