A sphere of pure unlaced darkness.  The casing around it appears to be clear,

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same
way that a deadly sword is beautiful. She's exactly like a sword --
whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.

This hideous face is like a mask, only the eyes and mouth have been sewn shut

without strings.  Much larger than a normal human face, and much more rugged,
this face appears to have been peeled off whole from someone, then prepared to
be worn as some kind of hat.  The face feels moist, as if it was freshly

These are not so much slippers as they are actual hollowed out feet, chopped

foot was severed, and has been expertly, if not magically, preserved.  
Stitched together like shoes so as to allow anyone to wear them, the
resemblance to halfling feet is unmistakable regardless.

The rather large paw seems to emit the elemental energy of its previous
owner. Mere proximity to this item seems to enhance your sense of smell...
you can't help but wonder what other use this item might have...

extradesc: memento lover's lovers lovers-soul soul locket platinum
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.

   These pants are made out of a satiny material that feels soft and smooth,
cold on the outside but comfortable when worn.  Large pockets should have
enough room in them for as many oddments as one could desire, and a thin
drawstring at the wait insures that they should fit anyone.  Given their
shimmering appearance and comfortable fit, it is almost certain they are
magical in nature.
