It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~

This is the ring of a god, granted to one who has shown great courage and
fortitude in retrieving items of certain value.  The Lord Tanle has, however
reserved the right to call on the wearer of this ring if and when it suits his
purpose, or may repossess the ring at any time.  The ring is a slender platinum
band of rare, incalculable value with a small, pink, white, blue, green, and
purple stone laid in the top.~

perfect for sneaking while armored.  In addition, they are very light, which
keeps them from impeding movement.  A pair of boots like this would be a

The shard of dragonscale is very warm to the touch, apparently maintaining some
of the heat from the dragon it once protected.  A tiny clip is attached to the
back of the shard, allowing it to be fastened to a cloak or tunic.  A small
dragon claw is etched into the clip.~

bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

Darker than any night sky, this blade appears to be crafted from a solid piece
of darkness.  Not a gleam nor sparkle, the blade seems to swallow light rather
than repeal it.~

The shadows form into small metal studs spaced across the surface of these
pure black gloves.  Clearly forged with magic, these gloves make no noise and are
difficult to see.  They allow for a full range of motion with the hand, making
them perfect for quick, deft tasks.~

These bracers look as though they are regular metal which has been extracted
from a long and coolly burning fire.  They are scarcely more than bands of
metal any longer, but are solid despite the long, slow burn.    ~
