This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.

This is a stained old bucket made of wood.  It is rather stout and has a handle
oneach side.  It appears to have been used quite a lot, yet it doesn't leak.

The cloak seems to be jet black, and yet ...  Seems to be a swirling mass of
colour.  You touch it, and it feels neither cold nor warm to your touch, yet at
the same time, you get a strange sensation of burning and freezing.
