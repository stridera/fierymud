The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is both too
bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.~

This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.    ~

foot was severed, and has been expertly, if not magically, preserved.  
Stitched together like shoes so as to allow anyone to wear them, the

These gloves seem very thick and would probably protect the wearer from heat.
Most useful for a smith or armourer.  They seem to give off small puffs of
white powder when they are beaten though?~
extradesc: white powder asbestos
Hmm, the white powder seems to be asbestos.  Lovely.  Course with your
lifestyle I wouldn't think that would be the cause of your demise >;-)~

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.~

As you look at the bracelet, you begin to wonder if it is really there.  It

wants to be in.  All you know is that you like it.~

A small ball of light glows from an unknown source, but somehow still remains
attached to a shining platinum chain.  It looks like a common necklace, except
for the small glint of light that emits tiny beams that illuminate the palm of
your hand.  Occasionally the light grows brighter for an instant, then fades
back to normal.~

From: Laoris

There once was a pale little assassin,
Whose friends were all surpassin',@0
So he vowed to himself,
"I'll kill them myself."
But help was needed for this amassin'

He tried training really hard to be tough,
But since he was never quite strong enough,
He cried out to the gods,
"Please give me your odds"
And one answered, "first get me some stuff."

"I want you to travel the world's oceans
But don't just go through the motions:
Face all your fears,
Bring back souveniers...
I think I want twenty different POTIONs."

"Next, some items obtained like Robin Hood:
Four armor-providing items constructed from wood,
Four non-drinking items of melted sand,
Four things made of chicken, and
Four objects with permanent protection from good."

Now nearing the end we look back and review,
And realize that one task is long overdue,
"Kill 100.0 of any goodly knight,
trophy-spell GLOWINGLIGHT,
And sanctuary shall belong to you."~

extradesc: skullcap-decay skull-cap sallow-face barbarian
This hideous face is like a mask, only the eyes and mouth have been sewn shut
and the edges of this face have been bunched up, like it is meant to be worn
without strings.  Much larger than a normal human face, and much more rugged,
this face appears to have been peeled off whole from someone, then prepared to
be worn as some kind of hat.  The face feels moist, as if it was freshly
harvested.~

To Muuth:

For your last spell, you will be questing for Shift Corpse.
@0
The power to shift the corpses of friends (and enemies,
as the case may be) is not an easy task by any means.
It will require extensive knowledge of the corpse. No doubt
you have acquired such knowledge in your chosen profession
of Necromancer, but we should like to see such knowledge
demonstrated in a more practical form, so please bring
me two "hand"s, a "paw", four "breast"s, a "chest", five
"heart"s, two "stomach"s, thirteen "head"s, five "eye"s,
nine "leg"s, two "limb"s, both a "foot" and a "feet",
and two "ear"s.

I will also require a "precious" item with which to
decorate the corpse.

Finally, to prove your mastery, destroy 5 "spirit"s,
two "body"s, five "head"s, an "arm", and a "hand".

Good luck in your quest!

Laoris~

I apologize for the confusion; it doesn't actually respond to either the wo@0rds
'bloody' or 'quill'.  However, it is indeed a bloodied feather.  It is also a
key, so I will accept simply a mudmail containing the item's name and description.

Good luck,
Lao~

Muuth,

Of course your power shall be granted,
But first an understandin@0g must be planted:

The power of death is not to be trifled,
For many a great man's life it has stifled.

Approach with much care and offering @ythree@0 @cjewel@0s;
Wear only @cash@0 as per the underworld's rules.

Gather @cblood@0 from @yseventeen@0 @rpriest@0s' sacrifice,
Enough to fill up a @cdecanter@0 @ytwice@0.

And then sign the contract with a @cbloody@0 quill
Upon a @chuman skin@0, sealing your new skill.

-Laoris~

A slender golden band with delicate whorls of knotwork is the setting for a
rather remarkable gem.  Though it is a small sapphire, no bigger than a wheat
kernel, it is shaped into the form of a hawk descending onto ints prey, talons
outsretched.  It was surely crafted by magic, for what gemcrafter, no matter
how skilled, could perfectly replicate something that small and detailed?~

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.~

It's an extra-long quill from the back of an Eldorian Porcupine.  Though
extremely painful when jabbed into bare flesh, young punk sorcerers use these
as quills for scribing spells.  Being thinner than a bird feather, they make
impressive, spidery-looking letters but also break more easily.~

Hi Coyo,
 
I hope you don't mind, I just pulled the items from your inven@0tory and
completed your quest.  And just so you don't have to bother with mud-
mailing me again, here is your next quest:
 
Resurrection is a delicate thing, requiring mastery of both life and
death. To unlock her secrets, you will need to find me a few items
such as:
 
A "shank" of BONE and death's "disguise" to start, love's "token" of
the one who cries, and a HEART that never dies.
 
One embued with "essessence wrongly taken," and the might of he who
would "bridge the gap between this world and the next," combined with
the volume of "saving grace" for me.
 
Lastly but not least, a SPECKLED "paradox" as offering and the RARE
"pear", to ensure we are not vexed.
 
Be sure to bring a VEST that isn't a "gloomy" thing.
 
Along the way, you'll need to greet five different ANCIENTs, four
STALKERs, and three HIGH PRIESTs, two GHOULs, and one SUCCUBUS ... for
research of course. And by greet I do mean the end of a blunt object
(or sharp, as the case may be).

I know this is really late so...let's just skip banish and plane shift.
We@0'll go straight to word of command.  For this spell, please collect
15 books, 1 item of force, and something shimmering.

Greetings Young Priest:-
As it turns out, Mera had a bottle of nostrum, wh@0ich she gave me to hold.
I also have the mistletoe brew, and the bubbling flask.  Unfortunately I
junked the bottle of nostrum when I was trying to get rid of the bottle of
water from the memorial garden.
But happily, Gilgal had a bottle of nostrum which he let me have, because he
feels like he owes me.
Well, all I can say, is that he doesn't owe me anymore.
Well, all I can say, is that he doesn't owe me anymore.
