This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.  It is
enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside of the ball
cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small sun, radiating
bright light in all directions.  If you have this item, luck, determination and
the Gods are with you.~

Merely a chip off a much larger dragonscale, this shard seems to have retained
much of the resilience of its previous owner.  Faint ridges run across the
shard's red surface, swirling and squiggling almost into recognizable images.
The shard of dragonscale is very warm to the touch, apparently maintaining some
of the heat from the dragon it once protected.  A tiny clip is attached to the
back of the shard, allowing it to be fastened to a cloak or tunic.  A small
dragon claw is etched into the clip.~
extradesc: claw etching clip
The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky
finger, but its detail is exquisite, with every scale on the claw painfully
chiseled into the metal.  The claw has a burning blue color, its glow somehow
drawing you in...~

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes are

strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form interesting
geometric designs.  This necklace is a charm from the Wizardess Thekra; you

around it is vividly dark and gloomy, creating a supernatural look.  There are
no apparent straps used to leash it to your face.  It seems that the smoke is
wrapping around your hands as if to hold on, so it might do the same for your

extradesc: tiara sapphire-tiara gleaming-tiara silver
Very cold to the touch, this circlet is made of silver worked into angular
designs and inset with a large, teardrop-shaped sapphire at the crown.  The
silver gleams brightly, showing no sign of tarnish, and the sapphire is a true
deep blue with an inner radiance all its own.~

extradesc: spellbook book large tome book-of-healing legendary-large-book
This is no ordinary book, this is the book of healing that for centuries has
kept Nordus free of plagues and serious illnesses.  The whole book is magical,
and there are records of how its power prevented the village of Nordus being
overcome by plagues on several occasions.~

extradesc: bag tattered tattered-bag ripped torn rune-covered
A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

Heavily enchanted cloth has been woven together to create this magical robe.  
Pieces of clothing like this focus mystical energies, making them easier to
manipulate.  Most sorcerers find clothing like this can strengthen almost any
arcane workings.~
