It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes 
are strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads. Here and there 
little strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form 
interesting geometric designs. This necklace is a charm from the 
Wizardess Thekra; you recognize it at once.

tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into its brocade surface. It's quite
heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held together by a bronze clasp,
beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon whose raised fists
make the clasp circular in form. The ankle-length cloak is lined in black
silk and edged in crimson. Your blood stirs inside you as you look at it,

Orcs, notoriously disdainful of horses, have no qualms about making tools from
their body parts.  This is one example.  The workmanship is rough and the
pieces oddly cut.  However, it will carry a quantity of water.

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.

this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.

   These pants are made out of a satiny material that feels soft and smooth,
cold on the outside but comfortable when worn.  Large pockets should have
enough room in them for as many oddments as one could desire, and a thin
drawstring at the wait insures that they should fit anyone.  Given their
shimmering appearance and comfortable fit, it is almost certain they are
magical in nature.
