This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  This thin tattoo lays right on one eyebrow,
curving over the ridge like the natural curve of a snake's fang.  The fang is
highly detailed to represent a real snake's fang and shaded to match the
contours of the brow ridge.  Brilliant yellow highlights give an animalistic
pop to the overall image.~

extradesc: chestplate-hope chest-plate silver-chestplate
The chestplate is pure silver in color, radiating in the light and reflecting
it back with a bit more intensity.  The metal has been polished and kept very
clean, even though there are minor imperfections such as sword marks and small
dents.  There are markings along the sides, etched into the metal.  The
markings bear the letters SH and are surrounded by runes of some sort.~

A brownish color on the outside and a cream color within, the small cake of
elven waybread looks about as delicious as a bread can be.  Unlike other
similar-appearing waybreads, this cake crumbles delightfully, releasing a
scrumptious aroma.  It is rumored that elven waybread is far more nutritious
than any human food, and that it is closely guarded by the elves and is only
rarely awarded to others.    ~

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

As you look at the tapestry, your spirit rises from the sublime colors and
expert weaving of the piece, then falls, as you notice how ragged its edges
are, and how obviously neglected it is.  There's no way it can be repaired, you
see.  That's too bad.  If it were in better shape, it'd be worthy of a lord's
castle.  You might even want to put it in yours, if you ever get one.~

Grotesque and ugly, the severed goat's head oozes blood from its neck just
below the jawbone.  Its whitish hair is stained and matted, clumping and
sticking in knots.  A limp pinkish tongue droops out of its mouth between rows
of vicious-looking teeth, forming a puddle of horrid-smelling drool beneath it.~

The book is leatherbound, and masterfully made, with thick paper pages. 
Written there, in flowing, well-trained script, you read:

   Day 22, Month of the Winter Wolf
   My men go out today to battle the Frost Elves across the mountains. I do 
   not know how to prepare my troops. Yesterday, Lady Rill sent her Amazons 
   to assist me in Queen Serazais' mad quest, but I do not know if even 
   they will make much difference in this fight. We are outnumbered. That 
   obscene little man Serazais sent me, that outlander necromancer, last 
   night cast a spell he said would protect us, but I don't believe it'll 
   work. Ah!-- I hear the war-trumpets. Pray to whatever gods you pray to 
   that at least some of us will return alive, my dearest Thraja.

This is the last entry in the book. You see no further entries in the 
beautifully crafted journal. ~

interest, excitement, fear, and love.  Holding the feathered garment in your

This is a pair of fine goggles, made of expertly tanned leather and lenses of
thick glass.  Excellent for protecting the eyes from the loose dust and
occasional hazards in a mine, they would probably also be useful outdoors in a
sandstorm, though underwater use would probably ruin the leather and is not
recommended.~

extradesc: octant dull-gray-metal-instrument grey
Made of a gray metal, and tarnished with age, this small handheld artifact has
seen better days.  It has two metal struts that are attached at one end and
splay apart.  At their far end, a gradiated strip of brass curves from one to
the other in an eighth of a circle.  It appears to be an octant, which is used
to find one's location out at sea, with the help of the stars.~

Smoky quartz is a powerful mystic matrix because it energizes like clear quartz
but also has strong connections to the realms of sleep and dreams.  Mounted in
a silver setting, a pendant like this provides powerful connections to both the
moon and the Reverie, making it highly prized by faeries and witches alike.~

Dramatic, but dented, and very much in need of polishing.~

extradesc: kimono imperial-silk-robe thick red-embroidery
This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.    ~

Made of thin black cotton, this kimono blends in perfectly with the shadows of
night.  Silk would provide a telltale sheen, though it would also be lighter,
but the black-dyed cotton absorbs light rather than reflecting it.  It is
utterly silent, not even giving the usual "whoosh" of fabric when moved.  The
sleeves fall only to the elbows, providing plenty of room to swing a weapon.  ~

Made of a thin, stretchy material lined with a warm layer of fuzzy down, these
sleeves would be perfect for keeping your arms warm beneath your overcoat.  
However, the thin material would provide little benefit for warriors and might
seem even a bit sissified for the more beastly of occupations.  The thin
material has enough stretch to it that you might even be able to wear the
sleeves about your legs like a pair of tights in a stretch (no pun intended!

These fine pants are made of a light fabric to which are sewn hundreds of soft
feathers.  The plumage looks to have come from all sorts of birds, with long
blue and green feathers likely from parrots lined up beside the smaller browns,
whites, and greys of birds like finches and budgerigars.  Though their value as
armor might be questionable, the breeches do look to be rather warm and even
comfortable - and a must-have for every dandy's wardrobe!~

They are solid and well fashioned, yet appear to have degraded in the flames

This large suit of armor is made from several large sections of tanned hide,
stitched together in layers with sinews and cord.  The hides clearly come from
several different creatures, lacking uniformity of texture or color.  A full
broad collar and shoulder pads have been collaged together, and the panels hang
long, covering some of the hips and waist for full coverage of the torso.  
Some of the sections have fur pressed between them, and other parts are
embellished with fox tails and other large fur pads.  The overall effect is a
patchy, mangy look.~

do look effective in helping you traverse the killingly cold snow of the arctic
fields -- and they might protect you a little bit too.~

Oof!  How could anyone walk around in these things?  It looks like an ordinary
pair of leather boots, except that the boots are actually made of a dark grey
stone!  Maybe they were turned into stone by magic, because not even dwarves

its way.  At the bottom, just above the grip, the words Injoni Rif are forged
into the thick steel.~

The iridescent sword gleams in the light, almost like its giving off some light

middle with a blood groove, from tip to shoulder.  The handle of the sword is
wrapped in what looks to be dragon skin, sewn together with a golden twine.  
There is a small inscription on the pommel.~

This is a six-foot length of dull black links.  The dark, sullen metal from
which they were forged reflects little light.  The links are nearly
rectangular, and lie almost flat due to a clever design.  The claw at the end
is rectangular as well, except that its pointed tine juts outward at a small
angle.  The claw is perhaps double the size of a link.  Stains and scratches
abound on this weapon.~

blades do a number on someone's arm or fingers, and wouldn't it be something to
see the metal handles protruding from the back of yon adventurer?  Indeed, the
shears make for a nasty weapon.
 
There is an inscription of some sort along the handle.~

You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far from
here.  It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much lighter, lucky
for you!  The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's slightly clenched
clawed forefoot.  But it's fallen on hard times--its handle is broken, and its
surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft and balance.  It's still quite
usable, though no experienced warrior would be interested in wielding it, since
its power is greatly reduced because of its condition.  But a junior trainee
would be thrilled to have this once-impressive weapon.~

Nothing.
   Obviously whoever wrote this note lacks the linguistic skills needed to write
legibly and convey coherent thought.  It seems very disorganised, and drifts
upward as you read.  It was scribled with charcoal onto the back of a 30 year
old eviction notice.  The paper is crumpled, and dirty.~

&0This neatly rolled parchment looks quite new, perhaps two weeks old at
the most.  Its crisp white paper is nicely kept, as is the swirling blue
text that has been scrawled along its surface:

Do not worry, Lord Gundbard.  The key is safe with me.  I apologize for
abandoning my post, but rumors were abound of trouble near Fangron
Forest.  My oath bound me to protect the innocent, so I must leave
immediately to offer my aid.  I should be back within a week's time.

Sir Gloris Whiteblade,
Holy Templar~

Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food
make this area a haven for all sorts of creatures of the forest.

   The cover of the book is formed from a solid chunk of bark, with the spine
made somewhat flexible by soaking it in some liquid and gently bending it into
shape.  Each page seems to have once been a leaf from a local tree, torn into a
roughly rectangular shape.  The writing is done in some kind of charcoal or ash
- because of this, the contrast makes some of the words hard to decipher.  On
the whole, the book is in fairly good shape, and is still readable.    

The headings in the book are PAGE1 PAGE2 . . .  PAGE8~
extradesc: page1
Well, I must do something to keep myself from going mad.  I figure I shall 
write my thoughts, as I have an eternity to postulate about things. Why,  
you may ask, do I have an eternity?  Settle in, the story is quite long.

Years ago, I was king of a prosperous kingdom in a land you've probably 
never heard of.  We farmed our land quite efficiently, and there were no
major problems in the kingdom for years at a time.  Then,  I had a son,
Errious, brought to me by my lovely wife.  He was a strong young lad, and 
quite fit to take over the throne after I passed on.  

He loved to travel, and over time mapped out parts of the land outside our 
borders, where noone in our family had likely set foot on for generations.  
In the process, he met a lovely elven woman by the name of Norina. He made 
sure to stop by her home as often as he could in his journies, often for 
just a day at a time, while relaxing after exploring. 

The text continues on PAGE2~
extradesc: PAGE2
Now, around the time that Errious was to return, I fell ill, and was bedridden
for several weeks with a delierious fever. In the meantime, my wife took over
rule of the kingdom, which was the norm when I was unavailable.  When my fever
finally broke, I was disheartened to find out that my son had not yet returned. 

My wife had sent one of our finest horsemen to the area where we knew he had 
headed. Several days later, we found his head, and a note.  It seems that our 
neighbors didn't like our latest visits.  In the meantime, my wife had rallied 
our knights, and had sent them to attack our newfound enemies. 

In hindsight, it was a hasty decision.  It was a fairly even match, but because
of that, the war raged on.  With our proximity, they managed to destroy our
crops, and we in turn, immolated theirs.  Both sides were suffering greatly,
and no real progress was being made in either's favor. 

The story continues on PAGE3~
extradesc: PAGE3
Finally, after several weeks of battle, both sides spirit had been broken, and
we sent a courier to ask for a diplomatic meeting between their leader, Izaro,
and myself.  By this point, his kingdom too was greatly suffering, and he
agreed.  We agreed to meet.    
 
In the meeting we discussed the war- after saying somethings that shouldn't be
said, it turned out that Errious had been seeing Norina, who was Izaro's
daughter.  Alas, Norina was married to a prince from a nearby kingdom, who was
helping his father put down a peasant revolt during the 'visits'.    

One day, he had returned to find Norina and Errious.  He claimed that Errious
had killed Norina, and he defended himself.  I know that cannot be true- I
raised him better than that.  More likely they were both killed in a fit of
jealousy.  In either case Norina and Errious both died that day, and both our
people demanded blood.    

The drama unfolds on PAGE4~
extradesc: PAGE4
We sent our men away, and agreed secretly to a dual to end it all.  Both our 
sides had lost too much, and the fighting needed to end now.  We chose to meet 
far away from the kingdom, and take turns leading farther into the forest, far 
away from any help one's kingdom could give.  It was to be a truely one on one 
battle. 

We eventually reached an area of dense forest with a clearing, and mutually 
decided it would be the setting of the battle.  I could tell by his ways that 
he was a spellcaster, and he could tell by my sword that I wasn't.  As the 
battle begun, I immediately rushed him, and kept him dazed enough to keep him 
from casting. 

And so the battle went.  He was a quick man, and kept from taking too many 
blows, but I was wearing him down.  But then, he managed to sprint out of my 
range, and got off one spell.  I never believed in my life that one spell could 
end my life, but as he finished his incantation, I looked up and saw a large 
ball of light, heading for me.

The end is on PAGE5~
extradesc: PAGE5
The large ball of light turned out to be a burning rock, and it was quite 
enormous. Before I could react, it crushed me.  One spell, and I was dead.  I 
suppose my soul wanted vengeance.  I couldn't just die, and thus I'm here now.
Somehow, he managed to capture me in this. . . room.  For some reason I can't 
escape. 

So I sit, and think, and write.  I know not what happened to Izaro- he could 
not have made it very far, as wounded as he was.  The forest was still full of 
dangerous beasts, and the smell of blood was sure to attract more. But I 
cannot help but feel he wasn't destroyed, otherwise why would my soul be 
trapped here?

Someday, I will destroy him, and in doing so, hopefully be free to finally 
venture into the afterlife.  Until then, I write. Someday, someone may find 
this, and I hope it will teach them something.  War is stupid. If only I would 
have realized the consequences so long ago, maybe things would not be as they 
are. ~

This page consists of a number of sketches of what seems to be the same thing 
from different angles.  It appears to be a suit of armor with some sort of 
wings attached to the back of it. The wings are connected with some elaborate 
pulley system to the arms, giving the look of a bird which tangled itself up
in a net.

The caption reads 'Para-assault System'. ~

In my time here, I have learned much about nature.  I've learned to make
fire from basically nothing.  I've learned to use the remnants of that fire to
write this book.  I've learned that with the right point of view, nature is a
powerful entity.  

As such, I write the following such that you might glimpse just a touch of 
the powers of nature that I have learned in my many years here. May nature be 
there for you whenever you need her.  

King Thelmor 

Beneath the signature is a series of runes that are rather indecipherable, 
especially in their current condition.  It would be amazing if whatever he 
imbued this book with still worked.    ~

This giant crate is made of wooden planks.  It looks like it was made
by someone who didn't exactly know what he was doing.  There are gaps
between some of the planks and some of the nails are bent.  But, it 
functions quite well as a crate.~

Someone had to have paid thousands of gold pieces for such a spectacular piece
of artwork - yet this wondrous little figurine came from within an actual
bird's egg!  Accurate down to the smallest detail, this heavy metal statuette
of a cockatiel is encrusted with jewels of all sorts: dark brown faceted
tourmaline stares back as the bird's eyes, small citrines and rubies create the
distinctive orange cheek patches, and smoky quartz and clear diamonds make up
the feathers.~

This large weapon is a two-handed sword with a very long blade made of steel
with very little in the way of sharp edges, since it's meant for brute hacking.
The hilt is made of bronze, with bronze crossguards and little ornamentation
or decoration.  The pommel is weighted perfectly with a smooth white alabaster
stone, opaque and milky-white.  There is no sign of what the stone signifies.~
