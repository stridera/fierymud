These work boots are made of dark brown leather.  They go about calf-high, and
though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled along its
edges.  They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable for anybody
wanting some basic protection.~

These cups fit exactly around their wearer's shoulder, protecting it from the
all-too-frequent blows that break through a fighter's defenses.  They're plain,
with only an embossing around their edges as decoration.  Leather straps hold
the spaulders tight against the shoulders and down part of the arm,
criss-crossing at the chest and back.~

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

This finely crafted sword is very heavy and has two handles to help you
compensate for its weight while you fight with it in battle.~
