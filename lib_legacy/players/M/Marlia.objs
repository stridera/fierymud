A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.~

whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you

It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~

This little glass bottle looks so delicate you swear you could destroy it with
a gentle breath of air.  Its stopper is made of some kind of filigree that
somehow still keeps the liquid in the vial from spilling out.  The liquid
itself is clear and seems to bubble and sway all by itself inside the bottle.~

This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~
