   The robe seems to be filled with swirling patterns of stardust.  You feel
part of yourself being sucked into the robe, but you don't care...  Becoming a
part of such a divine object would be a true honor!

   The cape gently pulls in the light so evenly and perfectly that the cape
seems to simply be a black void.  It is breathtakingly beautiful!  Looking at
it is all it takes to know that this cape is obviously divine.

   This staff is truly amazing!  It looks as if it could wield itself!  It
seems to made of the purest darkness of night, absorbing all light that would
reflect from it.  Pulsing softly, this staff is obviously divine, and well
beyond the ken of mortal creatures.
