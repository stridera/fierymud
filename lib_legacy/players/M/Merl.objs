This cloak was once quite fancy and shaped perfectly.  Now, however, it is torn
and somewhat discolored.  The silvery lining is shredded and has lost its glint
and sparkle.  The owner of such a cloak must have been quite wealthy, and it is
a wonder why such a precious item would go to waste.  It has a lone, long faded
symbol across the back.
