extradesc: lucky-rabbit's-foot
Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.~

The cloak is heavy and looks very warm, except for some ripped spots. The

carefully cleaned, probably by some freezing soldier, you can see the 
remains of bloodstains around the holes' edges. You consider wearing it 
yourself, since it still looks somewhat servicable.~

You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far from
here.  It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much lighter, lucky
for you!  The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's slightly clenched
clawed forefoot.  But it's fallen on hard times--its handle is broken, and its
surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft and balance.  It's still quite
usable, though no experienced warrior would be interested in wielding it, since
its power is greatly reduced because of its condition.  But a junior trainee
would be thrilled to have this once-impressive weapon.~

This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light
is so bright as to hurt the eyes, yet it is only a bit warm to the touch.  
Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead
of glass.    ~

Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.~
