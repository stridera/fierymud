The little doll is sewn together from scraps of cloth.  Facial features are
stitched carefully on the head, depicting a mischevious smile.  Something about
the doll just makes you want to pat it on the head!  A hooded cloak made of
brown felt fits the doll nicely, covering the seams where the arms are
attached.  Each arm has an odd little sword sewn on--the hilts are metallic,
but the blades are a strange glowing material.  The swords' glow slowly
alternates between subtle brightening and dimming, casting varying shadows on
the doll's face which seem to make its eyes come alive.~

extradesc: wings dragon-wings heap-silver-scales
A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.~

Made from the holy oak, a symbol of strength and stability, these tubes are
enhanced to act as natural armor.  Each sleeves is made of two smaller tubes,
wrapped in leafy vines that act as threads and cords.  Not exactly a fashion
statement, there is a raw natural beauty to these sleeves.~

These pants are made out of a satiny material that feels soft and smooth, cold
on the outside but comfortable when worn.  Large pockets should have enough
room in them for as many oddments as one could desire, and a thin drawstring at
the wait insures that they should fit anyone.  Given their shimmering
appearance and comfortable fit, it is almost certain they are magical in
nature.~

Crafted from the shoddiest paper, this helmet is both weak and uncomfortable.
It sits lighter on the head than a regular helmet, and doesn't seem to provide
any protection at all.  Large splotches of a reddish-brown ooze decorate its
outer surface, looking like dirt and poop.~
