extradesc: crown gypsy
This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit! A tie-waist secures
them at the waist, and the thick woolen material goes from there all the
way down to your feet. They look quite old, and seem to glow with some
kind of magical power. Perhaps they're enchanted!

These vambraces are of exceptional quality, and are simply bits of a magically

seem to repel light and seem to absorb impacts and then quickly reform the
dented portion.  The myst is a dull, absent grey color.

This beautiful cloak is made of some kind of silky white fabric
sewn all over with the most amazing white feathers. Each full,
white feather has a single dark blue dot near its tip, giving
the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to
dappled. The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body, with
a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at
the waist.
