Ramah    (Jan 26 2025) [ 1270]  Between my notes and the fact that 4 of the four questers have proof in trophy-score and the only missing is pawk's trophy that is now showing the first 1/2 and the full list is in my notes i assume that the quest was finished but waiting on yuhen to reward? so i've rewarded it.
