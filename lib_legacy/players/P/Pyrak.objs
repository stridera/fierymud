extradesc: emerald brilliant-green-emerald green-gem beautiful remarkable
   It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.

original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

  To: Pyrak
From: Laoris

Pyrak, student of pyromancy:
 
To command the fires of stars in battle, w@0e have finally
reached the stage where you must prove your mastery of
fire itself.  7 FIERY creatures and 2 creatures of FLAMES
stand in your way, so it will be necessary to defeat them.
As well, bring 13 items made of FIRE to show your
craftsmanship skill.
 
It is of course not as simple as that, for fire takes many
forms.  Bring 11 SHINING items as well, to command the
burning light present in the deepest vacuum.  And what
master of fiery skills would be complete without mastering
the stars that brings light and warmth to the world?  I will
need 4 STAR items and proof of the defeat of 5 SUN creatures
before you will have proved yourself.
 
Finally, to show that you can masterfully control explosions,
bring me 4 SHELLs and some ICE that does not burn.
 
One last bit of trivia and we are done.  Using the knowledge
gained by studying sorcery, for you must be well suited to
research after all this time, bring me the answer to a single
question: What old building contains an "Eerie Red Chamber?"
 
Once completed, you will be awarded with your most powerful
spell.  Good luck!

Pyrak-

The spell of relocation
Needs a little vacation
You must famili@0arize yourself
From mountains to ocean shelf
To decide where you're going
Requires prior knowing
 
So travel the lands
To locate a set of BANDS
Travel to the four corners
For four SUNs of foreigners
Find the NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST
To fulfill this quest
 
Face your greatest foes
And collect 10 ICE floes
Then brave the flames
Find those who share your aims
And vanquish 10 of FIRE
For the spell to which you aspire

-Lao

PS: Just for clarity, that's an item that responds to BANDS,
    not BAND.  So total 19 items and 10 mobs.  Good luck.

Dearest Pyrak of the Flame:
Apologies on the delay in assigning this quest@0.
Congratulations on achieving your stars!  Since you now wish 
to learn how to destroy stars with the power of Supernova, I 
will first need a Miniature Sun to experiment with.  The 
gravity will be intense, so bring also 13 HEAVY and two LIGHTWEIGHT items.  And in keeping with your class and the 
spirit of the game, please bring 7 FIERY items and defeat 
5 FIERY mobs.
Lastly, I shall need one piece of CAKE and two CANDLEs to put 
on it to celebrate the occasion!

This is a pair of fine goggles, made of expertly tanned leather and lenses of
thick glass.  Excellent for protecting the eyes from the loose dust and
occasional hazards in a mine, they would probably also be useful outdoors in a
sandstorm, though underwater use would probably ruin the leather and is not
recommended.

of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.
