You behold the legendary Stormcloak, once worn by the mighty Stormlord, Holder
of Tempests, himself.  The dark indigo cloth the cloak is made of scintillates,
giving the impression of thousands of tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into
its brocade surface.  It's quite heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held
together by a bronze clasp, beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon
whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you
look at it, touch it.~

extradesc: gloves thawkinixan-gloves stone-textured-gloves
The gloves appear to be white in color.  Their surface feels as hard as a rock,
yet they flex.  For looking and feeling like a rock, they sure are light.  
They must be magical...  What is this strange material?  There appear to be
some initials carved into the inside of the gloves.~

The main body of this exquisite ring is made of bright silver that seems to
glow aquamarine-blue with an inner light.  The pearl that adorns it is stunning
and larger than usual, with deep blue sapphires running otter-swift around the
main center of attention.  The ring is neither wide nor narrow, making it
wearable by either men or women.~

From: Chinok

To summon the forces of the heavens to call down a swarm of meteors is a ve@0ry dangerous prospect. It is essential, therefore, to be able to control these forces, lest they turn upon you.
Numbers being very important to rituals, I will need you to conduct a proper countdown before the summoning can be completed. As such, I will need:
    9 CHUNK 
8 ROCK 
7 FLAME 
6 FIERY 
5 SUN 
4 STAR 
3 STORM

The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is both too
bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.~

Salted meat isn't particularly appetizing, but at least it keeps longer.  This

About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.~

- it would be a shame to have such a nice ring shatter.~

A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

Made of a rough, heavy silk, the cloak is a tan color lined in white and,
judging by the way the fabric drapes, would sweep out impressively behind
anyone wearing it.  The dragon symbol is set in the center of the back, showing
a pale dragon done in metallic thread shimmering in the light, standing rampant
with a five-taloned foot raised as if in greeting.  The dragon looks, as
dragons tend to, extremely fierce.  Inside the collar in gray thread is the
maker's mark stitched into the fabric, but it is faint enough that it cannot be
read.~
