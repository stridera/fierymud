When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed
hastily with clumsy hands. The teeth vary in shape and size making you
wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

Heavy and sharp, it gleams with the polish of a well-loved weapon and would be
quite deadly to bare stone, trees, and anything else the owner would see fit to

Stonehelm".
