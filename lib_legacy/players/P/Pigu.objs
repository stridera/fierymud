ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,

You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far from
here.  It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much lighter, lucky
for you!  The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's slightly clenched
clawed forefoot.  But it's fallen on hard times--its handle is broken, and its
surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft and balance.  It's still quite
usable, though no experienced warrior would be interested in wielding it, since
its power is greatly reduced because of its condition.  But a junior trainee
would be thrilled to have this once-impressive weapon.~
