A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

Not much more than a sliver from a much larger dragonscale, the surface of this
shard still has the lustrous glitter of its original wearer.  The edges are
marred by jagged claw-like marks though, as if the shard were torn from the
whole scale by force.  A tiny pin on the back of the shard makes it easy to
clip onto a cloak or tunic.  A small dragon claw is etched into the clip.~
extradesc: claw etching clip
The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky
finger, but its detail is exquisite, with every scale on the claw painfully
chiseled into the metal.  The claw has a burning blue color, its glow somehow
drawing you in...~

of enchanted onyx or obsidian, these greaves are excellent armor for a dark

extradesc: heart ice-heart gleaming-heart pure-ice
This heart is made of gleaming ice and contains the essence that helped tie the
elemental to this plane.  It is rumored to bestow great powers to anyone who
wear it around their neck on a chain made of gold.  However such rumors are not
always true...~

These wings look so real!  A metallic golden frame supports two somewhat large
wings made of some kind of silk that stretches to the point of being almost
transparent.  Some kind of sparkly things are woven into the silk, making the
wings shimmer as they move.~

This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    ~

It reads,
"My thought will be for you
My love will be in you
You are the one to love me
So I will live forever"~

A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

Thick and woolen, this quilted garment seems like it would keep you very well
protected.  It's quite ancient, obviously, though still servicable.  To your
modern eyes, the embroidery on it seems distinctly unwarriorish, but in its
day, it must have been an extraordinary garment.~
extradesc: embroidery
The needlepointed designs depict fantastic birds and animals amid
twining branches and leaves. It must have taken forever to do it all.
In the corner of the tabard, needlepointed words read:

                  I am my beloved's
               And my beloved is mine.~
