extradesc: trumpet long-trumpet polished-trumpet
This kind of trumpet is traditionally used for heraldry to announce the coming
of knights or kings.  While well cared for, it bears clear signs of regular
use.  If it could speak, what stories of nobility and honor would it tell?~

This short length of rope looks like it has seen better days.  Made of a thick
hempen material, it has begun to fray rather badly at the ends and may not
support much weight.  Still, it would probably be quite useful in tying
something up.    ~

rice paper over the rods, you see thick white cloth, with a golden ball painted
on both sides.  It could hang folded from your hand, and then, with a flick of
your wrist, it could extend, becoming quite a parrying device.~

bamboo would make it an excellent whisk for the powdered tea of the tea

This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.    ~

Garlic is said to be able to ward off vampires.  It certainly will ward off
your friends if you eat too much of it, as it can cause very bad breath.  It
is, however, excellent at curing minor illnesses such as the common cold.  ~

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

Salt is one of the oldest and simplest spices known to man.  In some ancient
lands, soldiers were paid in salt.  It is used to preserve meat and usually
makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,
just sitting around.  It is the most common spice.    ~

no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces

Beneath the layer of dark soil at the top of the pot, is obviously a tuber of
some sort - even through the dirt, its glow visible.  Disturbing.    ~

This piece of thick leather has been expertly tanned and burnt with many odd
runes.  It looks to be a good piece of protection.~

extradesc: gloves blades bladed
The gloves each feature 3 long blades originating from the top of the hand.  
When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.    ~
