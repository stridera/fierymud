The whisk is only as large as a woman's hand, and made of bamboo.  Several
pieces of light bamboo have been woven together at the handle, their ends
allowed to fray to form a whisk. It's lightweight, and its whorled strands
of bamboo would make it an excellent whisk for the powdered tea of the tea
ceremony of Odaishyozen.~

This small watercraft is oval-shaped, with a single small bench in the middle.
It is constructed of a round frame of branches over which the skins of buffalo
have been stretched.  It looks like it's limited to a single human-sized
occupant.  The bottom is stained much darker than the rest, apparently due to
the body of water in which it has spent much time: Black Lake.

A sphere of pure unlaced darkness.  The casing around it appears to be clear,
letting the the view inside be known.  Black clouds seem to be moving within
the orb, lighting threads around violently.  It is its own world of chaos.
