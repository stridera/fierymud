These cups fit exactly around their wearer's shoulder, protecting it from the
all-too-frequent blows that break through a fighter's defenses.  They're plain,
with only an embossing around their edges as decoration.  Leather straps hold
the spaulders tight against the shoulders and down part of the arm,
criss-crossing at the chest and back.

You realise that this is a normal longsword which has been enchanted.  It seems
to be somewhat easier to wield.
