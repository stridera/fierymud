The writing on the wand is in an ancient elvish script and difficult to read,

requires a binding and sacrifice as part of the contract with an unidentified

extradesc: fiery red drakling scale
This odd little draconian scale is burning with some sort of internal fire,
making it quite warm but bearable to the touch.  It seems to impart some if its
fieryness into its holder, promising power and strength to its wearer.

glow of its own.  The surface of the bracelet slides and reacts when touched,
