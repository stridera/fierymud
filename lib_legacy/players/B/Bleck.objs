This delicate golden feather is about as long as your forearm. The

Oh, and it also glows like the sun. Just touching it makes your spirit

This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

this face appears to have been peeled off whole from someone, then prepared to

someone were large enough, they could probably use it as a quill pen, but other
than that it would make a nice trophy.

These are not so much slippers as they are actual hollowed out feet, chopped
off at the ankle!  The fur on them was obviously grown naturally before the
foot was severed, and has been expertly, if not magically, preserved.  
Stitched together like shoes so as to allow anyone to wear them, the
resemblance to halfling feet is unmistakable regardless.

Ok Bleck, your quest for the degeneration spell is simple:

Spell HEALALL@0MYZOMBIES on your trophy.  They must all be mobs, and
the names must be capitalized.  The phrase should go from top to
bottom.  For instance, if I had asked you to spell HELLO on your
trophy, it might look like:

@R&uKills       Mobiles&0

  To: Bleck
From: Laoris

Greetings, my dark pupil Bleck:

It has come to my attention that you sti@0ll lack your most
powerful spell. To remedy this situation, I shall grant
you a quest for the spell Shift Corpse.

The power to shift the corpses of friends (and enemies,
as the case may be) is not an easy task by any means.
It will require extensive knowledge of the corpse. No doubt
you have acquired such knowledge in your chosen profession
of Necromancer, but we should like to see such knowledge
demonstrated in a more practical form, so please bring
me two "hand"s, a "paw", four "breast"s, a "chest", five
"heart"s, two "stomach"s, thirteen "head"s, five "eye"s,
nine "leg"s, two "limb"s, both a "foot" and a "feet",
and two "ear"s.

I will also require a "precious" item with which to
decorate the corpse.

Finally, to prove your mastery, destroy 5 "spirit"s,
two "body"s, five "head"s, an "arm", and a "hand".

Good luck in your quest!

Laoris
