This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside
of the ball cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small
sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

extradesc: adornment light chain shimmering 
A small ball of light glows from an unknown source, but somehow still 
remains attached to a shining platinum chain.  It looks like a common 
necklace, except for the small glint of light that emits tiny beams that 
illuminate the palm of your hand.  Occasionally the light grows brighter for 
an instant, then fades back to normal.

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

extradesc: pearl pear rare
This pearl is like no other you have seen before.  Instead of being a circular
shape like most pearls are this pearl is in the shape of a pear.  It is also
quite a bit larger than most pearls too.
