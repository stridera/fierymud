This is the Cailaran Vest, which you've heard of in stories, seen in 
tapestries and paintings, even idly imagined seeking (and finding). It's 
a long green vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and 
flowing to the calves. The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in 
golden thread in a criss-cross pattern. The double-breasted collar is 
embroidered as well, in golden four-pointed stars. It'd look perfect with 
a silk blouse and breeches.

The scythe's blade is about the length of a human's leg, curved

about the same length as the blade. Overall, it's a gruesome weapon.

This sword's easily the length of your entire arm, and the blade itself
is thick and wide, with a blood groove deeply etched into its center.
It's clearly incredibly old. You just can't find this kind of workmanship

hey genius--
you already started the moonwell quest
this is the last thin@0g the dryad would have said... 

A dryad tells you, 'Now that we have the first gem, we can go for the second.'
A dryad tells you, 'The second item we need is an orb, representing the element'
A dryad tells you, 'of air.  This orb is somewhere in a dark fortress to the east.'
A dryad tells you, 'Please obtain the orb.'

extradesc: coracle bowl bowl-shaped watercraft craft
This small watercraft is oval-shaped, with a single small bench in the middle.
It is constructed of a round frame of branches over which the skins of buffalo
have been stretched.  It looks like it's limited to a single human-sized
occupant.  The bottom is stained much darker than the rest, apparently due to
the body of water in which it has spent much time: Black Lake.

pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.
