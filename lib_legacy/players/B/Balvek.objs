The yellow of this flower is so deep and shiny that it's reflected off any
surface brought near.  The stem is still green and unwilted, so it can't have
been picked long ago.    ~

This weapon is a steel ball mace affixed to a sturdy wooden shaft.  Its surface
is covered with runic embellishments, dedicating this mace to the service of
divinity, though its power is quite diminished.  The symbols indicate a
relationship with the Knights Templar.  Perhaps the Templar Magistrate in
Mielikki will know more.~
