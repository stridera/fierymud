This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.~

These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit!  A tie-waist secures them at
the waist, and the thick woolen material goes from there all the way down to
your feet.  They look quite old, and seem to glow with some kind of magical
power.  Perhaps they're enchanted!~

steel.  Embossed on the surface of the breastplate in a strange red ice is the
symbol of the cult of Tri-Aszp: a bleeding dragon's claw.~

This warm, large garment is tailored entirely from feathers.  Upon closer
examination, the cloak looks to be made up of a long cape and two wings
attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.~

anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.~

If the scales on this set of scalemail look familiar, perhaps it is because a
master crafstman painstakingly craft each one to resemble one of the scales of
the great black dragon, Sagece.  The scales must have been gathered during a
successful (meaning only several deaths to the party) assault upon her.  Or
perhaps the beauty of the piece of armor just provides motivation for creative
daydreaming.~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to

bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

copper rays.  It looks like it would make a fine identifying mark on a cloak.~

Examining this tiny light more closely, it becomes obvious this is no meager

through divine providence.  Within it lay all the hopes and dreams of creation,
which perhaps could become another legendary soul, or a cosmic array of life
and potential.~

Its color is that of the deepest black.  Expressionless ovals allow its wearer
to see, and small openings assist with breathing, but no other feature is
visible.  Indeed, it appears to float in front of its wearer's face with no
means of support.~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

This ring was forged from the power of the Undead.  Feeling somewhat like the
undead as you wear the ring, you become slower in your movements, slightly
enraged, and you feel yourself slipping into the ethereal realm....~

As you look at the small circlet you are awestruck by its beauty.  It sparkles
in the sunlight and must be worth at least a million bucks.  The circlet 
emanates a power of good, one that you wouldn't mind having for yourself.~

This shiny silver ring is slender enough for a woman to wear, but not
excessively feminine in shape.  It is set all around with amethyst cabuchons,
unfaceted and round-faced, set into silver edgings that are raised slightly to
show off the purple jewels.~

From Arseynh Z'Kenian
Z'Kenian House
Dheduu

Regarding the status of your request.  House Z'Kenian is more than
willing to trade soulsteel in exchange for thawkinixa, however
be aware that this is done without sanction of the city's ruling
body, House Kar'Shezden.  As such, we are unable to comply with the
second part of your request and we are unable to free the city's
troll slaves in exchange for dwarven ones softened by mind control
tactics.  The secret of forging adamantium must likewise remain
with the drow until further negotiations can be made.
Should you find these conditions acceptable, please respond with
all haste.
We await your reply.~

curving over the ridge like the natural curve of a snake's fang.  The fang is
highly detailed to represent a real snake's fang and shaded to match the
contours of the brow ridge.  Brilliant yellow highlights give an animalistic
pop to the overall image.~

These leggings are precisely manufactured of tightly bound fish scales,
pulled together to make very flexible, but very strong armor.  Softly glowing
and humming a nearly inaudible tune, these leggings bring to mind stories of
the sea and of the merfolk that inhabit its depths.  Perhaps there is more to
these seeming fish scales than meets the eye...~

This belt appears to be made of small silver discs set with dark blue starstone
hemispheres.  However, upon closer inspection, you realize the glittering dots
within the hemispheres are not merely reflecting light - they are diminutive
pinpoints of luminescence contained in some kind of crystalline matrix.  They
swirl and float, giving a cosmic life to each disc.  Surely a treasure like
this must be a gift from the Gods!~
