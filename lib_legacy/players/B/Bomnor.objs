A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a
grip, indicating that it could be used as a weapon.  Whether or not it would be
a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~

This little glass bottle looks so delicate you swear you could destroy it with
a gentle breath of air.  Its stopper is made of some kind of filigree that
somehow still keeps the liquid in the vial from spilling out.  The liquid
itself is clear and seems to bubble and sway all by itself inside the bottle.~

Shaped like a small artist's rendition of the sun, the core is made of a
brightly glowing yellow material that is cool to the touch despite the light it
sheds.  Extending from the core in four directions are flame-shaped reddish
copper rays.  It looks like it would make a fine identifying mark on a cloak.~

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.~

You realize what this is, it is the horn of the mythical unicorn. Amazing!~
