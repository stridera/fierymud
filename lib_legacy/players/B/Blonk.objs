This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!
     (Hint : you need something to write on...then
      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)

This mallet is simply made, with a oak wood shaft about the length of your
forearm and a head made of many layers of rawhide pressed together and dried.
It'd be useful for a handyman.
