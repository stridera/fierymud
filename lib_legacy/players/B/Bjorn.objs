Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.~

The doll is a horrid looking thing: it's little, greenish, and looks like the
blob.  Under the globs of gelatinous gleaming gunk, glint the green eyes of a
gooey effigy.  Its original visage is difficult to make out, because of all the
green gelatin caked on it.  The goo is quite sticky, causing anything touching
it to become lodged in the mess.~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

extradesc: memento-lover's-soul memento-lovers-soul platinum locket
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    ~

"My thought will be for you
My love will be in you
You are the one to love me

This little glass bottle looks so delicate you swear you could destroy it with

somehow still keeps the liquid in the vial from spilling out.  The liquid
itself is clear and seems to bubble and sway all by itself inside the bottle.~

Feather-light silk is artfully sewn into leggings, gathered at the waist and

changing as it is moved and shimmering in the light.  They look like they would
be rather baggy, but comfortable - how not, as they are made of the finest
silk?~

The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in golden thread in a criss-cross

four-pointed stars.  It'd look perfect with a silk blouse and breeches.~

take it and wind it around your body twice, loop it in a specific way, 
and let the ends fall to your calves. It seems like it'd hamper your

extradesc: starsword star-sword glittering-steel-blade
Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.    ~

The little doll is sewn together from scraps of cloth.  Facial features are
stitched carefully on the head, depicting a mischievous smile.  Something about
the doll just makes you want to pat it on the head!  A hooded cloak made of
brown felt fits the doll nicely, covering the seams where the arms are
attached.  Each arm has an odd little sword sewn on--the hilts are metallic,
but the blades are a strange glowing material.  The swords' glow slowly
alternates between subtle brightening and dimming, casting varying shadows on
the doll's face which seem to make its eyes come alive.~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit!  A tie-waist secures them at
the waist, and the thick woolen material goes from there all the way down to
your feet.  They look quite old, and seem to glow with some kind of magical
power.  Perhaps they're enchanted!~

This very old shackle's made of steel.  There are numerous little dents in its
surface, but it still seems supernaturally strong.  It fastens with a steel
clip.~

This sword's easily the length of your entire arm, and the blade itself is
thick and wide, with a blood groove deeply etched into its center.  It's
clearly incredibly old.  You just can't find this kind of workmanship these
days.~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

The shield has many dents in it but seems quite sturdy.  The surface of the
shield is painted with images of heroism and valor.  It original owner was
surely a mighty warrior who held these values in high esteem.~
