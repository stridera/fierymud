Made of a raw, tan-colored silk that is much heavier than normal silk, the
kimono is patterned with leaves of red, yellow, orange, and brown.  The leaves
are embroidered on with silk thread, making them shine in the light.  The body
of the kimono must have been made of raw silk so that the textures, both
tactile and visual, would complement each other.  This robe is truly a work of
art.    ~

Once golden-haired with a beautiful, rich brown mane, this lion's head is now
severed from its body, clotted blood matting the edges of its hair.  A terrible
expression of wrath and anguish is locked onto its face, hinting at its
agonizing downfall.  Much of the insides of the head have long fallen out,
leaving a hideously gross interior large enough to fit another head in.    ~

The book is large and heavy, and is sealed with red wax.  Large, golden words

making you realise that this must be a book of power.  One of its stories tells
of a visit from a band of powerful sorcerers who were impressed with Neris'
kindness and presented her with a holy scarab that has some power to it.  The
leader of the sorcerers is shown speaking aloud to Neris refering to her as
"Neris'Kaan", or "Neris the Kind".~
