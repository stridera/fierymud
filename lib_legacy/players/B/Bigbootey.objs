Gross!  This armor appears to me made of small circles of bone.  It seems
rather protective though.

This simple tunic is crafted from a rather boring beige cloth.  It isn't very
thick, made more for style than for overall protection.  It wouldn't provide
much protection, but it is certainly better than wearing nothing!  It's a
one-size-fits-all model, so it should fit anyone.
