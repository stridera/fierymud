This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.  It is
enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside of the ball
cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small sun, radiating
bright light in all directions.  If you have this item, luck, determination and
the Gods are with you.~

This is the ring of a god, granted to one who has shown great courage and
fortitude in retrieving items of certain value.  The Lord Tanle has, however
reserved the right to call on the wearer of this ring if and when it suits his
purpose, or may repossess the ring at any time.  The ring is a slender platinum
band of rare, incalculable value with a small, pink, white, blue, green, and
purple stone laid in the top.~

Though they are indeed solid black leather, these gloves appear to be covered
in thick smoke which emanates from the pores of their surface.  The effect of
the distortion from the smoke is akin to a heatwave passing through the desert.
Although by appearances they should offer little in the way of protection,
these gloves boast the strength and resilience of the demon whose skin they
were made from.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

Merely a chip off a much larger dragonscale, this shard seems to have retained
much of the resilience of its previous owner.  Faint ridges run across the
shard's red surface, swirling and squiggling almost into recognizable images.
The shard of dragonscale is very warm to the touch, apparently maintaining some
of the heat from the dragon it once protected.  A tiny clip is attached to the
back of the shard, allowing it to be fastened to a cloak or tunic.  A small
dragon claw is etched into the clip.~

The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky
finger, but its detail is exquisite, with every scale on the claw painfully
chiseled into the metal.  The claw has a burning blue color, its glow somehow

You behold the legendary Stormcloak, once worn by the mighty Stormlord, Holder
of Tempests, himself.  The dark indigo cloth the cloak is made of scintillates,
giving the impression of thousands of tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into
its brocade surface.  It's quite heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held
together by a bronze clasp, beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon
whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you
look at it, touch it.~

A simple strip of leather, long enough to be wrapped around the head twice and
then tied, this headband could in the loosest terms be described as a circlet.
It reminds the wearer of the principles of monastic life over the trappings of
fashion and material wealth.~

and hard, prepared to stand up to extreme use in a fight.  A gift like this is
never given lightly, and is only given to those who have proven they know when
to attack, and when to withdraw.~

Slippers of this sort are given to monks who have proven themselves as more
than adepts and have moved to the level of a true master.  Stamped with the
symbol for the original wearer's order, they are otherwise unadorned.  Made of
tan leather, this pair is worn and obviously well used.~

The most powerful weapon a monk master can ever use is his fists, and these
wrappings prove that.  Meditation chants and order scriptures are written all
over these strips which can be laced around the hands, protecting them like
gloves and focusing all of a monk's energy into their strikes.  Written on one
strap is a dedication to the original bearer.~

Armwraps like these would make for poor armor in any other situation, but in
the hands of a truly dedicated monk, they function as a focus for internal
strength and power.  The natural abilities of one such person come to the
forefront, increasing their defensive and offensive capabilities.~

The leather straps at the top and bottom of each plate are much longer than
they should be, allowing each to be wrapped around the entire leg once, then
tightened and tied off.  Such an armor style is very unique and actually
functions fairly well as armor, as well as being a reflection of the simplicity
of monastic life.~

Easily worn under a robe or a cloak, this harness looks more like a fetishist's
personal clothing than armor.  The entire suit is inscribed with scriptures,
giving it a sort of holy torture that allows the wearer to clear their mind of
all but themselves.  By transcending the limits of the body, the monk becomes
one with the mind and the greater universe around them.~
