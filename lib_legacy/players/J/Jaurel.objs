The yellow of this flower is so deep and shiny that it's reflected off any
surface brought near.  The stem is still green and unwilted, so it can't have
been picked long ago.

This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light
is so bright as to hurt the eyes, yet it is only a bit warm to the touch.  
Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead
of glass.

Golden, buttery pastry crust forms a double-handful of some
kind of handheld pie. You smell meat inside it, a little cool
from its earlier baking, but still delicious.

These loose-fitting pants are made of some thick, woolen material
dyed an intense azure blue. They're quite wide and loose at the
ankle; it's fairly obvious you're supposed to tuck them into your
boots or lace them down tight.
