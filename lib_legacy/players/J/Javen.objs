extradesc: foot lucky-rabbits-foot lucky-rabbit-foot
Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.

They are finely tailored of regular coarse linen and dyed black.
With their close-fitting form, they certainly cut a nice figure
beneath a robe.

This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light
is so bright as to hurt the eyes, yet it is only a bit warm to the touch.  
Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead
of glass.
