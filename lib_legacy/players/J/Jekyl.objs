   The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow. Gazing 
into its crystalline depths, there seems to be insubstantial forms 
floating within it. Before you can decide what lies within, you are 
forced to look away, lest its light blinds you.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

around it is vividly dark and gloomy, creating a supernatural look.  There are
no apparent straps used to leash it to your face.  It seems that the smoke is
wrapping around your hands as if to hold on, so it might do the same for your
face.

The book almost hums with power. You approach it reverently, ready to see
the face of some god in its pages, but then... Then... You feel its sheer
evil resonating. This is no ordinary book. And it is nothing holy.~

extradesc: lantern pumpkin jack-o-lantern
Ancient legend tells of a greedy man named Jack who tricked a Prince of Hell
and was forced to roam the mortal realms as a ghost for all eternity.  The
Prince took pity on the poor soul and tossed a coal of Hell at him for a light,
so that he need not spend eternity in darkness.  But the coal was too hot for
Jack to touch, so he dropped it on a pumpkin.  The coal burned a hole in the
squash, and Jack used it as his lantern.  Now they are carved with scary faces
to ward off the Prince, and lit in memory of Jack.

This is a pair of fine goggles, made of expertly tanned leather and lenses of
thick glass.  Excellent for protecting the eyes from the loose dust and
occasional hazards in a mine, they would probably also be useful outdoors in a
sandstorm, though underwater use would probably ruin the leather and is not
recommended.

extradesc: orb
   The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow. Gazing 
into its crystalline depths, there seems to be insubstantial forms 
floating within it. Before you can decide what lies within, you are 
forced to look away, lest its light blinds you.

   Made of a smooth white cloth, these gloves are very stiff.  They have a
slight glow and radiate a feeling of strength, though they are cold to the
touch.  A faint tingle also permeates the fabric, indicating that they were
definitely created with magic.

This slender rapier is long, its blade not sharp but is point wickedly so.
It is made of some very bright alloy of steel that looks almost silvery,
and its hilt is wrapped in blue leather. The crossguard is the traditional
basket hilt, but very ornately done, sweeping and scrolling.

The blade of this slender dagger is about a half foot long and razor

alloy of steel and silver, with not a nick marring its surface. The
hilt is hardwood set with gold chain, its pommel carved into an eagle's
head.

extradesc: longsword sword well balanced tower
It is a well-balanced weapon with a double-edged blade that is
somewhat sharp at the point. A scrolled bronze crossguard protects
the hand, and the wooden hilt is wrapped with chain for a good grip.
It is not a fancy weapon, but it is effective-looking. An insignia
in the pommel identifies the sword as belonging to one of Kerristone's
tower guards, to those who would recognize such things.
