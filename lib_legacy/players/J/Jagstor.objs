These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.

The long wooden oval frames support your feet on interlaced thongs, and 
strap on by way of leather buckles. They don't look very impressive, but 
they sure do look effective in helping you traverse the killingly cold 
snow of the arctic fields -- and they might protect you a little bit too.

Flat and relatively simple, but obviously well kept and of superb construction,
a bracer like this is usually a reward for a warrior far advanced in their
training.  After being forged by the dwarves from the highest quality steel, a
tribal or familial marking is etched onto the outside of the bracer, while the
original bearer's name is inscribed on the inside.

This bracelet is made out of a very durable weaved grass that has several
spaced out snake fangs weaved into it.  The fangs are about an inch in length
and give the bracelet a menacing look.  The grass is a dull green color and it
is weaved tightly so it looks almost like it is one piece of grass.

appearance, this helm is a reminder that to be a champion means having a quick
