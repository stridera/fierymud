extradesc: emblazoned-baldric large-ornamented-belt leather
This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.~
