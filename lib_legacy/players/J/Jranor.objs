Warm to the touch and bright as the morning light, this small ring seems to
have no physical structure or support.  It appears to have been made of light
fused into a semi-solid and stable shape that adjusts naturally in size.~

This breastplate is somewhat small, likely designed for an elf or slender
human.  It is formed from a strange metal, ice-cold to the touch, yet not
melting in heat.  The plate is much thinner than steel, not even as thick as
most swords.  A series of leather straps on the back may be tied together to
hold the breastplate on.~

This thin visor is cast from a mysterious white metal.  Apparently stronger
than steel, despite its thinness, it is almost impossible to deform.  A strap
hanging around the back allows the visor to be worn on the head to protect the
face.  Several vertical slits give the wearer a clear view of the surroundings.~

The leather straps at the top and bottom of each plate are much longer than
they should be, allowing each to be wrapped around the entire leg once, then
tightened and tied off.  Such an armor style is very unique and actually
functions fairly well as armor, as well as being a reflection of the simplicity
of monastic life.~

symbol for the original wearer's order, they are otherwise unadorned.  Made of
tan leather, this pair is worn and obviously well used.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

within the hemispheres are not merely reflecting light - they are diminutive
pinpoints of luminescence contained in some kind of crystalline matrix.  They
swirl and float, giving a cosmic life to each disc.  Surely a treasure like
this must be a gift from the Gods!~

Marked with only the symbol of a monk's order, this wristguard is very tough
and hard, prepared to stand up to extreme use in a fight.  A gift like this is
never given lightly, and is only given to those who have proven they know when
to attack, and when to withdraw.~

The most powerful weapon a monk master can ever use is his fists, and these
wrappings prove that.  Meditation chants and order scriptures are written all
over these strips which can be laced around the hands, protecting them like
gloves and focusing all of a monk's energy into their strikes.  Written on one
strap is a dedication to the original bearer.~

A simple strip of leather, long enough to be wrapped around the head twice and
then tied, this headband could in the loosest terms be described as a circlet.
It reminds the wearer of the principles of monastic life over the trappings of
fashion and material wealth.~

Easily worn under a robe or a cloak, this harness looks more like a fetishist's
personal clothing than armor.  The entire suit is inscribed with scriptures,
giving it a sort of holy torture that allows the wearer to clear their mind of
all but themselves.  By transcending the limits of the body, the monk becomes
one with the mind and the greater universe around them.~

Armwraps like these would make for poor armor in any other situation, but in
the hands of a truly dedicated monk, they function as a focus for internal
strength and power.  The natural abilities of one such person come to the
forefront, increasing their defensive and offensive capabilities.~
