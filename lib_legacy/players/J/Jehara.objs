This robe literally emanates power as you hold it in your hands.  It once
belonged to the great lich Kryzanthor.  No wonder he had so much power!
Any undead that had its hands on this thing would be a tough force to beat.

extradesc: starsword star-sword glittering-steel-blade
Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.

Mounted on a sturdy leather bracelet, a small leather sleeve hides a
silver-hued dagger that can be flipped out with a skilled flick of the wrist.
The bracelet is secured on the wrist by several thin leather straps.  The
dagger is a little longer than a human hand, reaching just far enough from the
wrist to do some serious damage.
