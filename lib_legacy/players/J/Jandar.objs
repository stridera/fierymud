This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside
of the ball cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small
sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little

extradesc: mythril saintly vambraces
These vambraces are forged from mythril, a metal that when in its purest form,
can hold great spiritual power and divine favor.  Each set of vambraces like
these is made for a specific cleric in the name of a specific deity, both of
which are indicated in intricate designs across the surface of the plates.

Large, decorative symbols for sight and clarity cover this sanctified helm.  
Both symbols are stylistically enclosed in the sign of the original wearer's
patron spirit.  Blessed by the gods, this helm grants clerics a closer
connection to their deities in their travels.

   A pure white flower tips the stalk, its fragrance subtle and sweet. 
It brings to mind thoughts of romance, and lovely ladies. Its softness 
reminds you of its fragility, and the need for it to be protected.

Crafted from a solid shard of hardened night, the ring refuses to let even
light caress it.  The band is thin yet does not seem weak by far.  A small
place at the top feels very thick and round.  At a straight look it is almost
like one could see movement from inside.

Examining the bracelet closer, you see images of fierce boars somehow printed
on it. You're now quite sure how, or even what exact material the
bracelet is made of, though you suspect some kind of magically treated boar
skin.
