This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.

Aww, it's a cute little wing feather from a song sparrow.  It looks delicate,
but could probably be used as a quill to scribe with in a pinch.

They are finely tailored of regular coarse linen and dyed black.
With their close-fitting form, they certainly cut a nice figure
