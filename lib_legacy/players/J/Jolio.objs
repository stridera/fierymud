Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

It is a fine bracelet that looks like it was carved from one large pearl, with
a twisting whorled design inlaid with gold.  It fits over the wrist, sliding on

This staff was made from the limb of a Silveroak tree. Perhaps the Druid
who originally owned this powerful staff received it as a gift from the
tree, for it is inconceivable that anyone would harm a Silveroak by
cutting off a limb. The staff retains the tree's bark and shimmers brightly
in the light.~

Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.    ~

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

Oregano is a rather mild herb used to add zest to otherwise plain dishes.  It
is said to help in restoration spells and help someone with chronic weakness
gain strength.  It goes well in tomato sauces with basil and garlic.    ~

   A single stalk of dill, complete with a fist sized umbrel of yellow-green
flowers, grows in a small earthen pot.  Basking in the unnatural glow of the
room has benefitted the plant, which has a strong aroma.  The stalk seems to be
in good condition, nearly ready for harvesting of its oil.    ~

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.    ~
