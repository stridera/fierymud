extradesc: bracers-loong embellished-sapphire-bracers chinese-dragon-bracers
Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

white feather has a single dark blue dot near its tip, giving
the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to
dappled. The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body, with
a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at

in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....
