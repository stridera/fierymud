This is no natural gem! It's the eye of a Hiver Queen, detached from its
socket. The many eye facets that once gazed upon the world with ambitious
lust still gleam faintly in death.

the subtle decorations to the fine straps, makes it look expensive and
highly effective. There are only a few little dents in its surface to mar
its mirror-like perfection.

This cloak was once quite fancy and shaped perfectly.  Now, however, it is torn
and somewhat discolored.  The silvery lining is shredded and has lost its glint
and sparkle.  The owner of such a cloak must have been quite wealthy, and it is
a wonder why such a precious item would go to waste.  It has a lone, long faded
symbol across the back.

The mask is a stark white, depicting a man with strong features and a

eyebrows are painted black.  The edges of the mouth are slightly upturned
in a knowing smile.  Something appears to be written on the inside.

extradesc: message inside
The inside of the mask is a little gritty, a result of the unpolished
ceramic.  A short message is penned impossibly small on the inside of
the chin:

Remember, remember the Fifth of November,
The Gunpowder Treason and Plot,
I know of no reason
Why Gunpowder Treason
Should ever be forgot.
