   The shovel is large and unwieldy. It would probably be difficult to use this
properly if you aren't strong enough.

These work boots are made of dark brown leather. They go about calf-high,
and though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled
along its edges. They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable
for anybody wanting some basic protection.
