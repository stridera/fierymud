When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.    ~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

Thick and woolen, this quilted garment seems like it would keep you very well
protected.  It's quite ancient, obviously, though still servicable.  To your
modern eyes, the embroidery on it seems distinctly unwarriorish, but in its
day, it must have been an extraordinary garment.~
extradesc: embroidery
The needlepointed designs depict fantastic birds and animals amid
twining branches and leaves. It must have taken forever to do it all.
In the corner of the tabard, needlepointed words read:

                  I am my beloved's
               And my beloved is mine.~

shockingly blue surface.  It reflects a fierce strike of lightning as you look

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

An airy-light robe of the finest silk shimmers and shines in the light,
reflecting many colors that change as it is moved.  Every color in the rainbow
is represented here and there, though if the fabric is moved the colors shift
again.  It looks like it is all made of one solid piece of fabric, hemmed only
at the collar and the sleeves.  It looks like it would be loose but comfortable
to wear.~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for

the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.~
