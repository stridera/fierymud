As you look at the large white dragon's egg, you seem to remember something you
heard long ago.  Something about how a dragon's egg had special powers.  Now
what was that.

Of all things, dragon skin is incredibly rare.  The scales are hard and a dark

silver gleams brightly, showing no sign of tarnish, and the sapphire is a true
deep blue with an inner radiance all its own.

Cut from the head of a rather small dragon, this draconian face has been
carefully removed from its previous owner, and affixed with padding and
a strap to allow it to be worn.  It is dried and surprisingly light, but
retains an odd musk from the dragon's flesh.  The dragon's snout 
extrudes
almost a foot from the wearer's face, and the eyes are removed, letting
the wearer see out through the perspective of a dragon.
