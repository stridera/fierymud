This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside

sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

This lone horn is very large and curved.  It is cracked and broken in two
places: a large break marks the spot where it was wrenched from the mighty
demon Krisenna's head, and a smaller break is higher up.  The smaller end is
worn, as if the horns were smoothed after the injury.  Whether this was done in
battle or for vanity is impossible to tell.  Some power remains in the horn,
damaged as it is.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time
itself -- that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater
than any the world has ever known, true love and blackest hatred,
friendship and betrayal.. all couched in the language of ancient
times to form a manual of behavior for magicians in the aftermath
of a war the likes of which may never be seen again... Though the
majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out or damaged,
enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.
~
extradesc: cover
The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.
~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.
~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.
~
extradesc: page3
This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small
caption near the bottom of the page reads "NAU I S". That is all you
can tell for sure.

extradesc: earring dragons blood 
   The earring is brilliant red, shimmering in the light.  The material that
comprises the red color covers most of the earring except the stud, which is a
dull silver color.  It emits a small trail of smoke, which seems to come from
the dried on blood that forms the outer layer of the earring.

extradesc: dagger black dagger-black
Large and made of a blackened metal, this dagger looks like it was made for the
hands of something larger than human.  Its leather grip is bloodstained but
comfortable, and it looks like it has been replaced more than once.  Its pommel
is a crystal of the colorful, rare mineral thawkinixa.

extradesc: iron rations
These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.

This heart is made of gleaming ice and contains the essence that helped tie
the elemental to this plane.  It is rumored to bestow great powers to anyone
who wear it around their neck on a chain made of gold.  However such rumors
are not always true...

This tambourine is made of two wooden discs pegged together. Through
the gaps in between them, someone has thrust pairs of small brass
circles. The slightest movement makes the circles jingle together,
producing a wild, mysterious cacophony.
