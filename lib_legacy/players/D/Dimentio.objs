As you look at the large white dragon's egg, you seem to remember something you
heard long ago.  Something about how a dragon's egg had special powers.  Now
what was that.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

Made more for protection and recognition than strength and battle prowess,
these gauntlets are made from many small plates linked together, but are
relatively unadorned.  Strong spiritual enchantments have been placed on these
gauntlets however; the healing aura around them is unmistakable.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

A tingling feeling radiates from this bracelet, which appears to be made out of

beneath the sparking there seems to be some kind of hard base, so wearing it on

dappled. The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body, with
a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at

can hold great spiritual power and divine favor.  Each set of vambraces like
these is made for a specific cleric in the name of a specific deity, both of
which are indicated in intricate designs across the surface of the plates.

reflected. There seems to be a subtle difference between what you
see and how you remember yourself to appear to others. Perhaps this
is the real you.

extradesc: memento lover's lovers lovers-soul soul locket platinum
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.

A tingling feeling radiates from this bracelet, which appears to be made out of
the elemental force of lightning.  It is colored a pale bluish-white, and
beneath the sparking there seems to be some kind of hard base, so wearing it on
the wrist would be quite possible.

(Words in quotes are keywords.) 
To release a soul from the darkness of de@0ath
bring first two items of "darkness" to destroy
two candles will negate them
add a votive lamp to light your way further

to regain the soul, use an item which allows you to travel in time
to rejoin it to the body, bring the essence of that which is reborn even as it dies
to represent the bond formed, an item which is "fragile" and one which is "strong"

last, to conquer death, defeat that which harbors plague:
10 kinds of rats
and that which spreads destruction:
11 agents of "evil"

This shield is made of bright blue-white steel, but it glows with
a faint pink aura. The design on the front is ancient and very
familiar, though you can't immediately place it for now. And if 
you put your ear against its softly thrumming surface, you can
hear what seems to be a lullaby, in a strong female voice touched
with gentleness.

Grotesque and ugly, the severed goat's head oozes blood from its neck just
below the jawbone.  Its whitish hair is stained and matted, clumping and
sticking in knots.  A limp pinkish tongue droops out of its mouth between rows
of vicious-looking teeth, forming a puddle of horrid-smelling drool beneath it.

clerics, to keep them safe and identify them as Lokari's to anyone who
might inquire as to their status. It's just a silver crescent-moon shape.

About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the

exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.
