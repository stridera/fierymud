These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

It is a plain steel longsword, with a fairly sharp blade and a
leather-wrapped hilt. Short bronze crossguards keep the hand a
little safe.~
