This is no ordinary cape -- it's that special kind used in swordplay.  A fabric

Those swirling folds of black and white satin would easily confound an
opponent, allowing you to seize their weapon in the satin.~

The helm is forged of a silver metal of the highest quality, giving it extreme

metallic substance, giving off a bluish tinted shine.  The back of the helm

The rock neckguard appears to be chipped and sculpted from a single large
stone.  Previously constructed for the huge Bozaks, it is almost too large for
your neck.  The neckguard is sturdy enough to withstand almost any attack.~

A shining plate, made of pressed felt and painted to look like steel, decorated
with elaborate designs, looks like it might actually hold up well in combat.  
Sculpted to fight a very well muscled warrior, this plate is a bit larger than
a normal one.  This isn't an item you would normally think of as a stage prop.~

   |&1&b1&0: There are far too many interesting things that go on in the theatre to 
   |   list them all here.  The players also tend to roam around theatre so
   |   pinning them to one spot is impossible.  So start here, talk to the
   |   Leading Player, and enjoy the magic (and madness) of... The Theatre!
