This ball of light is the most mysterious and magical things you have ever
seen.  The ball is very bright but yet dark at the same time.  The light shifts
from top to bottom and from side to side with small flares from time to time.
This is a miniature replication of the sun at midnight on some parts of the
earth.  Some great conjurer must have made this and given it to some great
person as a prize.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

Stormlord, Holder of Tempests, himself. The dark indigo cloth the 
cloak is made of scintillates, giving the impression of thousands of 
tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into its brocade surface. It's quite
heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held together by a bronze clasp,
beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon whose raised fists
make the clasp circular in form. The ankle-length cloak is lined in black
silk and edged in crimson. Your blood stirs inside you as you look at it,

This chunk of rock is about the size of a troll's fist and made of a deep
green, striped mineral called malachite.  It's made of horizontal bands of many
different shades ranging from dark moss to the pale green of new leaves.  It is
considered a soft stone, so it is possible that it was once polished but became
chipped.  However, this green stone is often found deep inside mountains.  
What is it doing in the swamps?
