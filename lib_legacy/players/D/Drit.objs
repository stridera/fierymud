You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

extradesc: wicked boots chaotic
These boots are an anomaly, for they have been polished smooth and clean, but
they absorb all light and reflections, making them boots of palpable darkness.
The occasional warp or buckle appears randomly on the surface, almost like the
boots are straining to conform to their shape.

The obsidian of the vambraces is run through with dark red swirls and streaks,
like unholy blood coursing through the veins of a demon's hide.  The sight of a
warrior clad all in armor of this nature would be awe-inspiring and horrific at
the same time.

extradesc: nasty jagged fiery greaves chaotic
Faint black flame surrounds these greaves, though they leave no burns when
touched.  Combine that with the sharp, jagged points along the edges, these
greaves appear to have come straight from some underworld realm.  Probably made
of enchanted onyx or obsidian, these greaves are excellent armor for a dark
warrior.

This black bracer pulses in time with your heart, as if sounding out in
response to your life force.  Warm to the touch and slightly organic in feel,
this thing seems more like a parasite than a piece of armor.  Still, it is
solid enough that it perhaps could be worn without problems.

This chestplate bares the image of a huge demonic face, pounded out in
bas-relief across the entire surface.  Forged from steel as burned as black as
night, then molded and dedicated to a particular evil entity, the wearer is
granted great unholy power, protecting them as they rain evil and chaos down on
the realms.

These wings look so real! A metallic golden frame supports two

the point of being almost transparent. Some kind of sparkly things
are woven into the silk, making the wings shimmer as they move.

extradesc: flesh gobbet roc solid meat chunk food
Cutting chunks from fallen rocs is not for the faint of heart, for their
brethren are quick to avenge their dead.  Anti-Paladins have no such fear,
however, and the flesh of these mighty birds is regularly consumed by them.  
Or perhaps it is not fear that drives others away, but the overpowering stench.
At any rate, this chunk of meat is fairly fresh...  And smelly.
