     Made of a thin, stretchy material lined with a warm layer of fuzzy down,
these sleeves would be perfect for keeping your arms warm beneath your
overcoat.  However, the thin material would provide little benefit for warriors
and might seem even a bit sissified for the more beastly of occupations.  The
thin material has enough stretch to it that you might even be able to wear the
sleeves about your legs like a pair of tights in a stretch (no pun intended!)

As you look at the tapestry, your spirit rises from the sublime 
colors and expert weaving of the piece, then falls, as you notice how 
ragged its edges are, and how obviously neglected it is. There's no way 
it can be repaired, you see. That's too bad. If it were in better shape, 
it'd be worthy of a lord's castle. You might even want to put it in 
yours, if you ever get one.

     The beak of a parrot, this grey hook-shaped bill has razor-sharp edges
honed daily by its former owner.  Though most birds are not aggressive, only
the most foolhardy would not look to its own defense.  It looks as if someone
has drilled two holes in the sides of the beak and run a leather thong through
them so that you could tie the hookbill onto your head; it might also function
well as a kind of dagger in hand.

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!
     (Hint : you need something to write on...then
      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)
