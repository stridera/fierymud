Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

extradesc: mask-deception smooth-black-mask
The mask is smooth to the touch, yet no highlights are visible on its surface.
Its color is that of the deepest black.  Expressionless ovals allow its wearer
to see, and small openings assist with breathing, but no other feature is
visible.  Indeed, it appears to float in front of its wearer's face with no
means of support.

against the elements.  Intricate green artwork decorates its outer surface,
depicting leaves and trees.

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

cloak is made of scintillates, giving the impression of thousands of 
tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into its brocade surface. It's quite
heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held together by a bronze clasp,
beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon whose raised fists
make the clasp circular in form. The ankle-length cloak is lined in black
silk and edged in crimson. Your blood stirs inside you as you look at it,

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same

is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared --

This long staff is made of some sort of dark wood that tapers from the
top to the bottom, which is capped in black iron. Two sections of its
length are wrapped in leather strips, though the rest of it is covered
in a regular arrangement of thick thorns. The bulbous top of the staff
is covered in them. This weapon, for weapon it must be, has a good weight
and heft in the hand.

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.

extradesc: cloak-ancient-wisdoms thin-cloak
You behold a cloak made of some kind of thin, blood-red damasked silk 
embroidered over with dark blue silk thread in cunning designs. The 
collar is lined in thick, deep brown fur. You get the uncanny feeling 
that this flowing cloak isn't quite what it seems. It seems to have a 
sense of power to it. Some sense of intuition you didn't even know you 
had tells you to handle this cloak carefully.

It seems to be a snowflake set onto a tiny silver post.  The six-pointed flake
is cool to the touch, though it does not melt.  Whatever crystal substance it
is made of catches the light quite well, giving it an ever-present sparkle.  
Its miniscule arms have hexagonal symmetry, and it is very detailed.

A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.

which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

make the clasp circular in form. The ankle-length cloak is lined in black
silk and edged in crimson. Your blood stirs inside you as you look at it,

extradesc: feather quill cavern-hawk-wing-feather immense sitting
This is the primary flight feather of the giant cavern hawks near the
Stormchild's keep.  Dark gold in color, it is nearly three feet long.  If
someone were large enough, they could probably use it as a quill pen, but other
than that it would make a nice trophy.

extradesc: ice eyes magical pair two
As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.

Sewn from the finest off-white cotton threads, this well-worn pair of
previously owned stockings promise its wearer warmth and comfort no
matter the environment.  Some slight stains mar the stretchy fabric,
but they are undoubtedly just an artifact of the production process.

This little stone flask is a perfect sculpture of a stony golem, save the
little stopper protruding from the top of its head.  Its hollow stone eyes
chillingly reflect no emotions or remorse...  Though that would seem to be
normal from such an inanimate object as this.

This dragon doll is truly adorable.  It is hollow yet very heavy, its surface
skillfully smithed from tiny burnished overlapping silver scales.  Little
crystals resembling ice are caked on its claws, as if the doll resided in a
frigid environment.  Although curled up in a sleepy little ball, one of its
large, glassy eyes is open, as if watching its surroundings carefully.

This slender-legged, bright white doll has a look of nobility in its
well-crafted stitches.  Clumps of stuffing ripple under its skin and its
underlying wire frame allows the doll to stand on its four little legs with
grace and assuredness.

polished black wand in her hand, pointing it aggressively at some 
unknown foe.
