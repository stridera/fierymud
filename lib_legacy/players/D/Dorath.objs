There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

pinpoints of luminescence contained in some kind of crystalline matrix.  They
swirl and float, giving a cosmic life to each disc.  Surely a treasure like
this must be a gift from the Gods!~

9th day of the Month of Discovery, 352

   If your reading this, well, the plans didn't go off correctly.  I wanted a
legacy to carry on.  This tower was to be it.  In my days, I saw many places,
full of traps and treachery, but also of wealth and other spoils.  I strived to
leave such a place myself.  Alas, I plan on destroying these notes when it is
done, thus if you are reading this, the tower is not.  As I write this, the
enchanted tower has been completed ; a grand four stories tall.  It's too bad I
will be destroying part of it soon.  . .
 
  Work will not be finished for months, I fear, and with my ailing health, I
may not live to see it done.  I've called upon many favors - I'm afraid even my
soul will be the cost in the end.  So far, there's not much loot in here, most
has been sold for the protectors of the castle.  Sweet irony.    

   In the end, I have turned to demons to protect the lair, and slave labor to
build it.  What have I become.  Perhaps this is what is truly killing me.  Tis
only luck that the blue dragon has made the tower his perch.  What would it
cost for such a guardian?    

The writing continues in part2, part3, part4, part5, part6, part7~
extradesc: part2
   First, I ask myself, why am I building this tower?  I have adventured for
many years, and have always been fascinated by places I had gone, both in the
architecture, and the secrets held within.  I have decided to leave a legacy
behind me.  Someone has to die for a tomb to be looted.    

   Alas, with a life of adventure came a life with no heirs, so my money is
worthless after I die anyhow.  I am still in good health now, but getting older
every day.  Thus, my life's goal.    

   I have enlisted a few of my more mystical friends for the construction.  
This shall be no ordinary tower, by any means.  For one, we have concocted an
enchantment for the stone of the tower, such that it shall rebuild itself if
e'er it gets destroyed.  The bits of stone are attacted to one another, such
that no matter the distance, they will slowly be pulled together again.  Yea,
it may take millenia if they are far apart, but the tower shall never be
destroyed.    ~
extradesc: part3
   This was quite costly, but I believe it will be a good investment in the
long run.  No matter what happens, the tower will never quite die.    
 
   The basement has been created.  We decided upon an infinite hallway to
protect my study.  It too wasn't terribly hard to create, merely a modified
dimension door spell.  I had to give up my grandmother's broach, though, to get
the work done.  My friends are quite stingy, they are.    

   Finding workers from an area far enough away that they won't be able to find
their way back was quite tough.  The southern continent was a good choice.  To
get back without help, they'd have to raft the blue fog sea.  I've ne'er seen a
bigger ship down there in my days.  Getting them back there will be tougher.  
Our ride got called off to tend to her father, dying of old age. ~
extradesc: part4
   Had the druid community not severed ties with me after the unfortunate
incident in the forest...  I hadn't honestly meant to hurt anything, especially
not the animals, and how was I to know that the owl was a shapechanger...  
Life would be much easier. 

   We just had a few incidents in the construction.  The sub basement floor
collapsed.  It turns out a giant worm has burrowed under the tower.  It turns
out to have some intelligence, I think.  I... agreed to keep it fed if it
did no damage.  I didn't realize how much it eats.  We may need to exterminate
it.    

   Some fool put a door on the second floor of the tower to the outside.  
Unfortunately, they're nothing outside of it.  I've locked it to avoid any more
accidents.  Two deaths were bad enough.  Perhaps they would have survived, but
evidently the door happened to lead right above where the worm had burrowed,
thus the pit was quite deep.    ~
extradesc: part5
   Part of our labor force has decided to abandon the project.  A few of
them...  Were threatening to break their vow.  I had to put them down.  I think
the rest will understand the graveness of the situation, and will realize the
penalties for betraying me.    

   The work force has mutinied.  After hearing tales of what I did to those
that left, they snuck out after I offered them a two day break.  I will track
them down one by one and punish them all.  Traitors.  First, though, I must
find a replacement work force...  Work most continue - the tower must be
completed I have taken ill as of late, quite severely.  I hope it will pass,
but I must press on in case it does not.  I am ...  Seeking connections at the
moment.    

   I have sought an audience with the Demon Lord Krisenna.  We have struck a
deal; he seems quite benevolent at the moment.  Hopefully it will stay that
way.  The deal works in both our favors.  They provide the workers and
protection, and I provide them with a safe entry way into our world.  They have
finished the external tower, and have retreated into the bowels to finish up.~
extradesc: part6
   I have allowed them free reign to create themselves a sealed off passageway
to keep anyone who might make their way in from getting to them.  I am not even
allowed to see what they are doing there, lest I bother them, or give others
knowledge of how to do the same thing.    ~
extradesc: part7
   I have just stumbled back across this book, and it weighs heavily on my
mind.  I have seen my soul blacken over time.  Alas, I think it is too late for
me.  They have taken almost all of my goods as tribute, and they have an iron
grip on the tower.  I plot, hoping to find a way to get rid of them, but I fear
the deal is done.~

These simple fake eyelashes can make a woman's eyes look darker and more
beautiful.  These brand-new eyelashes are fresh out of the box, pristine in
condition.  They would make anyone look more attractive.    ~

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

Several layers of pressed birch leaves have been sewn on to tanned hide to
create these boots.  These boots still seem to be in sturdy condition, ready to
handle any climate or condition, even though they have seen years of use.  Odd
that the leaves still seem to be fresh, as if picked from a tree and stitched
on this morning.~

The stem of this lotus actually goes nowhere, ending in a simple knot.  
However, it could easily be wrapped around the wrist, creating a beautiful and
exotic bracer.  The lotus is the ultimate representation of the ability of
nature to produce beauty and perfection from the darkest of places.  Such an
ever-growing blossom as this is created only for very powerful druids.~

The blue robe of silk has a single, mysterious symbol on its front.  While the
image is familiar, you can not place where you have seen it before.~

A closer look at the symbol reveals the paw print of a panther superimposed

find.  The creature who has fashioned this piece of armor has created an item
that can be worn on the legs, but attaches to the body like a skirt.~

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same

whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.~

portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.~

You've never seen such exquisite goldworking.  This locket, on its whisper-thin
golden link necklace, seems very old.  The hinges on it are coming a bit loose,
but it's still pretty tightly closed.~

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same
way that a deadly sword is beautiful. She's exactly like a sword --
whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry

Looking directly at this strange wispy spark, you develop a distinct sense of

your eyes, a mix of ecstatic excitement and serene comfort washes over you as
you begin to hear far away laughter and music.~

Made of a rough, heavy silk, the cloak is a tan color lined in white and,
judging by the way the fabric drapes, would sweep out impressively behind
anyone wearing it.  The dragon symbol is set in the center of the back, showing
a pale dragon done in metallic thread shimmering in the light, standing rampant
with a five-taloned foot raised as if in greeting.  The dragon looks, as
dragons tend to, extremely fierce.  Inside the collar in gray thread is the
maker's mark stitched into the fabric, but it is faint enough that it cannot be
read.~

extradesc: dreamcoat dream-coat long-partecolored-robe
This coat is made of long, narrow strips of cloth and leather sewn together
into a long-sleeved, heavy robe with inlaid armholes.  The cloth is red, blue,
and purple velvet, alternating with black leather.  When you put it on, your
head tingles with new ideas and the residue of dreams, making you feel a little
wild-eyed.~

A hard, round shell which feels almost chitinous emits a soft golden light and
a warm feeling, though there is no actual heat coming from it.  It is about the
size of an ogre's clenched fist and is heavy but feels hollow rather than
solid.~

At glance this appears to be liquid darkness.  Chaos within shape, as it's
shape is always redefined.  Whatever it touches it molds perfectly to, crushing

If it weren't for its bright red color, this precious splinter would go
unnoticed because of its tiny size.  However, as soon as it is picked up it
begins to emit a magical light.  It has clearly been enchanted.~

The mask shimmers slightly as you hold it up and you see yourself reflected.  
There seems to be a subtle difference between what you see and how you remember
yourself to appear to others.  Perhaps this is the real you.~

&0This neatly rolled parchment looks quite new, perhaps two weeks old at
the most.  Its crisp white paper is nicely kept, as is the swirling blue
text that has been scrawled along its surface:

Do not worry, Lord Gundbard.  The key is safe with me.  I apologize for
abandoning my post, but rumors were abound of trouble near Fangron
Forest.  My oath bound me to protect the innocent, so I must leave
immediately to offer my aid.  I should be back within a week's time.

Sir Gloris Whiteblade,

To Mesmeriz of the Minithawkin Mines
Dated The 11th Day of the Month of Heroes and Valor, Year 468.
From Arseynh Z'Kenian
Z'Kenian House
Dheduu

Regarding the status of your request.  House Z'Kenian is more than
willing to trade soulsteel in exchange for thawkinixa, however
be aware that this is done without sanction of the city's ruling
body, House Kar'Shezden.  As such, we are unable to comply with the
second part of your request and we are unable to free the city's
troll slaves in exchange for dwarven ones softened by mind control
tactics.  The secret of forging adamantium must likewise remain
with the drow until further negotiations can be made.
Should you find these conditions acceptable, please respond with
all haste.
We await your reply.~

These black leggings fit snugly over your legs and lower body.  Though they
don't give much protection, they do allow for an unrestricted range of motion,
as well as a sleek look.~

This shiny silver ring is slender enough for a woman to wear, but not
excessively feminine in shape.  It is set all around with amethyst cabuchons,
unfaceted and round-faced, set into silver edgings that are raised slightly to
show off the purple jewels.~

9th day of the Month of Discovery, 352

   If your reading this, well, the plans didn't go off correctly.  I wanted a
legacy to carry on.  This tower was to be it.  In my days, I saw many places,
full of traps and treachery, but also of wealth and other spoils.  I strived to
leave such a place myself.  Alas, I plan on destroying these notes when it is
done, thus if you are reading this, the tower is not.  As I write this, the
enchanted tower has been completed ; a grand four stories tall.  It's too bad I
will be destroying part of it soon.  . .
 
  Work will not be finished for months, I fear, and with my ailing health, I
may not live to see it done.  I've called upon many favors - I'm afraid even my
soul will be the cost in the end.  So far, there's not much loot in here, most
has been sold for the protectors of the castle.  Sweet irony.    

   In the end, I have turned to demons to protect the lair, and slave labor to
build it.  What have I become.  Perhaps this is what is truly killing me.  Tis
only luck that the blue dragon has made the tower his perch.  What would it
cost for such a guardian?    

The writing continues in part2, part3, part4, part5, part6, part7~
extradesc: part2
   First, I ask myself, why am I building this tower?  I have adventured for
many years, and have always been fascinated by places I had gone, both in the
architecture, and the secrets held within.  I have decided to leave a legacy
behind me.  Someone has to die for a tomb to be looted.    

   Alas, with a life of adventure came a life with no heirs, so my money is
worthless after I die anyhow.  I am still in good health now, but getting older
every day.  Thus, my life's goal.    

   I have enlisted a few of my more mystical friends for the construction.  
This shall be no ordinary tower, by any means.  For one, we have concocted an
enchantment for the stone of the tower, such that it shall rebuild itself if
e'er it gets destroyed.  The bits of stone are attacted to one another, such
that no matter the distance, they will slowly be pulled together again.  Yea,
it may take millenia if they are far apart, but the tower shall never be
destroyed.    ~
extradesc: part3
   This was quite costly, but I believe it will be a good investment in the
long run.  No matter what happens, the tower will never quite die.    
 
   The basement has been created.  We decided upon an infinite hallway to
protect my study.  It too wasn't terribly hard to create, merely a modified
dimension door spell.  I had to give up my grandmother's broach, though, to get
the work done.  My friends are quite stingy, they are.    

   Finding workers from an area far enough away that they won't be able to find
their way back was quite tough.  The southern continent was a good choice.  To
get back without help, they'd have to raft the blue fog sea.  I've ne'er seen a
bigger ship down there in my days.  Getting them back there will be tougher.  
Our ride got called off to tend to her father, dying of old age. ~
extradesc: part4
   Had the druid community not severed ties with me after the unfortunate
incident in the forest...  I hadn't honestly meant to hurt anything, especially
not the animals, and how was I to know that the owl was a shapechanger...  
Life would be much easier. 

   We just had a few incidents in the construction.  The sub basement floor
collapsed.  It turns out a giant worm has burrowed under the tower.  It turns
out to have some intelligence, I think.  I... agreed to keep it fed if it
did no damage.  I didn't realize how much it eats.  We may need to exterminate
it.    

   Some fool put a door on the second floor of the tower to the outside.  
Unfortunately, they're nothing outside of it.  I've locked it to avoid any more
accidents.  Two deaths were bad enough.  Perhaps they would have survived, but
evidently the door happened to lead right above where the worm had burrowed,
thus the pit was quite deep.    ~
extradesc: part5
   Part of our labor force has decided to abandon the project.  A few of
them...  Were threatening to break their vow.  I had to put them down.  I think
the rest will understand the graveness of the situation, and will realize the
penalties for betraying me.    

   The work force has mutinied.  After hearing tales of what I did to those
that left, they snuck out after I offered them a two day break.  I will track
them down one by one and punish them all.  Traitors.  First, though, I must
find a replacement work force...  Work most continue - the tower must be
completed I have taken ill as of late, quite severely.  I hope it will pass,
but I must press on in case it does not.  I am ...  Seeking connections at the
moment.    

   I have sought an audience with the Demon Lord Krisenna.  We have struck a
deal; he seems quite benevolent at the moment.  Hopefully it will stay that
way.  The deal works in both our favors.  They provide the workers and
protection, and I provide them with a safe entry way into our world.  They have
finished the external tower, and have retreated into the bowels to finish up.~
extradesc: part6
   I have allowed them free reign to create themselves a sealed off passageway
to keep anyone who might make their way in from getting to them.  I am not even
allowed to see what they are doing there, lest I bother them, or give others
knowledge of how to do the same thing.    ~
extradesc: part7
   I have just stumbled back across this book, and it weighs heavily on my
mind.  I have seen my soul blacken over time.  Alas, I think it is too late for
me.  They have taken almost all of my goods as tribute, and they have an iron
grip on the tower.  I plot, hoping to find a way to get rid of them, but I fear
the deal is done.~

The worn out leather book binding is almost falling apart.  It is very old
and the leather is well oiled from being handed by unclean hands.  The pages in
the book are hand written with a variety of inks giving light to the idea that
the pages were written on different days as if a journal would be.  You can
read a few of the first pages: page1, page2 and page3.~

For all that are powerful
Bringing fists down on the weak
Smashing their souls
And breaking the meek

May they soon meet their maker
Brought forth for their misdeed
Wrought down into the ground
Stomped flat their greed

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence 
Then let us to ascend~

   The quaint sounds of spring fill my ears with a joy not found else where.  
The breeze showers my skin with the sensations of the air.  This feeling
empowers me with the creativity that is unrivaled by others.  Like floating on
top of the world without the weight of gravity to pull me down.    ~

............THOUGHTS............
   Thoughts drain like water
  Down into the consciousness 
   Collected in a small form
Then spread out to be recollected 
  Rearranged and transformed 
Until they collide with perfection 
     Forming what would be
          What could be
 The greatest thought of them all~

Warm to the touch and bright as the morning light, this small ring seems to
have no physical structure or support.  It appears to have been made of light
fused into a semi-solid and stable shape that adjusts naturally in size.~

around it is vividly dark and gloomy, creating a supernatural look.  There are
no apparent straps used to leash it to your face.  It seems that the smoke is
wrapping around your hands as if to hold on, so it might do the same for your
face.~

This ear, with its blunt point, is recognizable as that of a leprechaun.  A
metal ring is mounted through the thickest part so that it can be worn, perhaps
as a trophy.~

extradesc: dagger emerald-hilted-dagger steel-bladed-dagger faceted-emerald-hilt
This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.~

You realize what this is, it is the horn of the mythical unicorn. Amazing!~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn

of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

This spray of vivid vine-grown flowers is pleasing to both the eye and the

for an elegant overall feeling.  Still attached to the vine, these flowers look
like they could be worn around the neck, woven into your hair, or worn on the
collar as an accent to any outfit.~

This weapon is a steel ball mace affixed to a sturdy wooden shaft.  Its surface
is covered with runic embellishments, dedicating this mace to the service of
divinity, though its power is quite diminished.  The symbols indicate a
relationship with the Knights Templar.  Perhaps the Templar Magistrate in
Mielikki will know more.~

The scroll appears to have some strange language written on it:

The mask shimmers slightly as you hold it up and you see yourself reflected.  
There seems to be a subtle difference between what you see and how you remember
yourself to appear to others.  Perhaps this is the real you.~

This is a fat, heavy crescent of solid gold with an off-center curl at one end
to go through a hole in the ear.  It shines brilliantly, and even seems to have
an inner glow.    ~
