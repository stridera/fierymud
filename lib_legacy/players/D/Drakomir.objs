thick black shiny stream of it, so that only the very edges of the

extradesc: longsword sword well balanced tower
It is a well-balanced weapon with a double-edged blade that is
somewhat sharp at the point. A scrolled bronze crossguard protects
the hand, and the wooden hilt is wrapped with chain for a good grip.
It is not a fancy weapon, but it is effective-looking. An insignia
in the pommel identifies the sword as belonging to one of Kerristone's
tower guards, to those who would recognize such things.
