A full pirate suit done in varying shades of red, it was definately tailor-made
for Dakhod.  From its red leather leggings to its striped red-and-white baggy
shirt to the dark red, bloodstained bandana that can be worn under a captain's
hat, this outfit is sure to strike terror into the hearts of mortals.    ~

A well-worn and tattered pirate hat, this nifty three-cornered hat sweeps up at
the front and has a faintly embroidered skull and crossbones on it.  Made of a
soft brown felt, this hat would be protective in both sun and rain, not to
mention in salty sea spray.  It has a fringe of brown feathers that are mostly
worn away, and inside the front brim is the faded name "Dakhod" written in
black ink.    ~

A stump of oak is fashioned into a replacement limb.  Weathered by much use,
the bottom is scratched and rounded as if it has scrambled upon a pirate deck
for many years.  Despite many scars of this nature, it seems very well made and
looks like it would support the weight of even a portly pirate.    ~

A pair of soft, velvety slippers with silver buckles is here, waiting for their

looking identical to the right slipper unless one peeks closely.  The look
quite flashy and are surely the envy or pirates everywhere.  Embroidered in the
inner heel of the right slipper is the name "Dakhod".    ~

something like this.  Engraved on the metal cuff is the name "Dakhod".    ~

looking closely into the depths of the gem you can see the blurry shape of
letters, forming the word "Dakhod".    ~

The little doll is sewn together from scraps of cloth.  Facial features are
stitched carefully on the head, depicting a mischievous smile.  Something about
the doll just makes you want to pat it on the head!  A hooded cloak made of
brown felt fits the doll nicely, covering the seams where the arms are
attached.  Each arm has an odd little sword sewn on--the hilts are metallic,
but the blades are a strange glowing material.  The swords' glow slowly
alternates between subtle brightening and dimming, casting varying shadows on
the doll's face which seem to make its eyes come alive.~

a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~
