This shirt is smaller than a normal shirt.  It's totally black, except on the

Salt is one of the oldest and simplest spices known to man.  In some ancient
lands, soldiers were paid in salt.  It is used to preserve meat and usually
makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,
just sitting around.  It is the most common spice.    ~
