locks the hinge on one side of the locket, enclosing the memories of those who
have passed on and become forgotten.  An aura of mourning and remoteness
surrounds the locket, flowing from the tiny portrait painted within-the face is
neither male nor female, neither old nor young.  Expressionless, the face
nevertheless seems to be lonely, crying for remembrance.

This is the Cailaran Vest, which you've heard of in stories, seen in 
tapestries and paintings, even idly imagined seeking (and finding). It's 
a long green vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and 
flowing to the calves. The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in 
golden thread in a criss-cross pattern. The double-breasted collar is 
embroidered as well, in golden four-pointed stars. It'd look perfect with 
a silk blouse and breeches.

the sea and of the merfolk that inhabit its depths.  Perhaps there is more to
these seeming fish scales than meets the eye...

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

evoking thoughts of vertigo and vengeance.  Visions of vaniloquence
vanish as the vial vaticinates a revelation of a venator vigorously
vitiating a once vivacious victim.

extradesc: book enchiridion ench
The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time
itself -- that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater
than any the world has ever known, true love and blackest hatred,
friendship and betrayal.. all couched in the language of ancient
times to form a manual of behavior for magicians in the aftermath
of a war the likes of which may never be seen again... Though the
majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out or damaged,
enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.
~
extradesc: cover
The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.
~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.
~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.
~
extradesc: page3
This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small
caption near the bottom of the page reads "NAU I S". That is all you
can tell for sure.

This is just a plain pair of glasses until worn.  Once placed over the eyes,
they begin to glow with a golden light and transform into a thin line of energy
that hums for a moment and then seemingly vanishes except for a small glyph
representing "Truth" that can be seen deep in the pupils of the wearer.

This is the ring of a God, granted to one who has shown great courage and
fortitude in retrieving items of certain value.  The Lord Tanle has, however
reserved the right to call on the wearer of this ring if and when it suits his
purpose, or may repossess the ring at any time.  The ring is a slender platinum
band of rare, uncalculatable value with a small, pink, white, blue, green, and
purple stone laid in the top.
