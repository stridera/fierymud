the owner's deity on it, meticulously and elaborately etched into the face.

extradesc: necklace bat tooth
When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed
hastily with clumsy hands. The teeth vary in shape and size making you
wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

   This large tattoo covers half the face, and is shaped like a cat's striking
paw, claws extended as if about to rend across the cheek from eyebrow to
jawline.  It's an impressive piece.

The golden elven leaves sparkle without reflecting any light.  The glinting
appearance comes from the ring itself, and would probably serve to warm the
finger it is worn on.

whatever its previous owner ate just before they parted ways. It smells
absolutely foul.

Clearly a gift from blasphemous powers, these boots ground the wearer to the
darker side of the world, keeping them rooted in the physical world while
expanding their powers in the spiritual realms.  No decoration has been added
to these boots, save for faint magical traces that vein them.
