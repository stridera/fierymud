A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.

extradesc: breastplate dark metal steel soulsteel plate
It is very light, for a breastplate.  The metal hardly seems to weigh anything.
It is a very strange metal, formed of black and grey swirls that are
constantly, if slowly, moving.  Touching a swirl with one's bare hands gives
something of a shock, as if you had laid your bare hands against a trapped
soul.
