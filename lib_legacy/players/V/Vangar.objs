extradesc: onyx chestguard zealot
Polished smooth and inscribed with several Infernal symbols, chestguards of
this variety are regarded as the pinnacle of evil devotion.  Given only to
diabolists who have shown great dedication to furthering the goals of unholy
forces, it brings the wearer into connection with their god, unifying them into
a singular terrifying force.

Forged from metal as black as night, this helm looks like a roaring demon head.
Cat-like eyes burn atop the helm, sharp teeth line the vicious maw and twisted
black horns spiral up from the sides of this unholy headpiece.  Infernal magic
radiates off this helm, burning away natural life and order.

Perhaps made of steel, these greaves are blackened as if burned or charred, but
still hold their original shape.  Small enough to wear comfortably under a long
robe or cloak, but large enough to provide adequate protection, each plate is
solid and sturdy, while not being bulky.  Each plate has the single symbol of
the owner's deity on it, meticulously and elaborately etched into the face.

These glossy onyx plates bear no decoration or distinguishing features, other
than an unnatural coolness.  The source of the cold must have to do with the
dark spiritual power that strengthens them, giving the onyx the strength of
steel and empowering the wearer in the name of the dark gods.

More than it would seem, this bracer is actually stolen from a holy order, then
transubstantiated through desecration into onyx.  Once the ritual is complete,
it is imbued with specific energy from the god it is dedicated to.  That
powerful link allows the bracer to call out to its god, pulling the wearer
closer to that being.

the tip of each prong, a wicked looking arrow looks sharp enough to rend stone.

This action figure appears to be an exact replica of Dakhod!  With a peg leg
and a hook for a hand, the attention to detail is stunning.  This action figure
comes complete with karate chop action when its legs are squeezed, and a
pullstring on his back.
