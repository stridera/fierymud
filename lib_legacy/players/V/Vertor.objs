locks the hinge on one side of the locket, enclosing the memories of those who
have passed on and become forgotten.  An aura of mourning and remoteness
surrounds the locket, flowing from the tiny portrait painted within-the face is
neither male nor female, neither old nor young.  Expressionless, the face
nevertheless seems to be lonely, crying for remembrance.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

extradesc: shadow girdle wide black band metallic links
This girdle is little more than a thick shadow.  It is a black band of tightly
interwoven, metalic links which are bound together to form the girdle.  Each
link is made of an incoporeal substance, shrouded within a tangible frame.

extradesc: orb sphere chaos ball
A sphere of pure unlaced darkness.  The casing around it appears to be clear,
letting the the view inside be known.  Black clouds seem to be moving within
the orb, lighting threads around violently.  It is its own world of chaos.

extradesc: large black scrap cloth bracer assassin
This 'scrap' of cloth is actually a perfect rectangle and has nicely finished
edges and small, nearly invisible cords hanging from two sides.  In addition,
it seems to be reinforced with bands of padding, making it comfortable to wear.
It could easily be tied to the forearm, and would probably blend in well with
the darkness.

It fastens with a steel clip.

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.

Obviously enchanted, these greaves are made from a single steel plate covered
with small black chain links, yet they make absolutely no sound.  They play
tricks with the light, fading in and out of sight occasionally, making both
them and their wearer difficult to detect.

extradesc: invisible coif assassin
Made out of pure shadow, a coif like this allows the wearer to do more than
hide; they gain the senses of the shadows themselves.  Prized by rogues and
assassins alike, a coif like this is rarely found, but given to a person who
has advanced to the highest ranks in their guild.
