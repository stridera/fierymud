This sword's easily the length of your entire arm, and the blade itself
is thick and wide, with a blood groove deeply etched into its center.
It's clearly incredibly old. You just can't find this kind of workmanship
these days.

It is written in ink that has gone brown with age on parchment that
is nearly yellow. The edges crumble as you read; you take special
care not to destroy this missive from the past. But it reads only:

      My beloved Arturio, please believe that I act only to protect
      you and Frederick. Remember the chants and spells I taught
      you and the rest of our family, and remember that yours is
      a rich heritage. Should you ever need the help of the Goddess
      Mielikki, you need only ask.

The letter has been folded and refolded many, many times.

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same
way that a deadly sword is beautiful. She's exactly like a sword --
whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several

which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.
