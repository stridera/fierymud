extradesc: book codes slender-volume
Some of the pages seem to be marked, in particular page16 and page37
which talk about future directions for more powerful spellcasters and
how to encode a simple cipher respectively.

The preface briefly states how essential it is for a spellcaster to
protect his spells against accidental or deliberate theft, by encoding
them.
~
extradesc: page16
A passage has been circled on this page, it reads:
    ...so in order to ensure that the magic user has a copious supply of
willing subjects for his experiments, he must first ingratiate himself with
his chosen town by generous acts. An intelligent mage will try and get
himself accepted into the council, and perhaps even move for a law which can
be used to aid him. This could state that all mad people be locked up, or
all criminals be killed. We all know how easy it is to turn a mind to madness
and the mage may then take these subjects 'under his protection' and
experiment on them without worry, as the populace soon forget what has
happened to them...

There is also a note in the margin which seems to be a calculation of some
sort and a reference to page23.
~
extradesc: page23
Ack, its a recipe for unlimited power, but it involves several unsavoury
ingredients including human organs. A passage has been circled on this page
too, and it reads:
    ...obviously in order to get this many human hearts is impossible
which is why this spell still remains theoretical, although if one were
to perfect some sort of cloning technique, coupled with a spell for creation
of a human, then it might be possible to create a human with many vestigial
organs which would presumably still be valid for the recipe...

Your skin crawls as you continue to read, anyone who really thought this
sort of stuff would work would have to be mad right?
~
extradesc: page37
There are some simple ciphers on the page here, and some notes in the margin
which look like the would have continued onto page 38, only that page has
been torn out of the book! You read the notes anyway and puzzle over the
missing data:
    ...and as has been known through history the simplest cipher is a
substitution whereby one letter is substituted for another (for example
the next letter in the alphabet) and the message is rewritten. The decoder
knows that the letters are shifted by a certain number of positions and
can easily decode the message. This is known as a monoalphabetic cipher. A
more complex 'polyalphabetic' cipher such as the Vigenere cipher may also
be used. The illustration on the next page shows this in action, but basically
the implementation is as follows:
     1) the keyword is chosen and repeatedly written below the phrase to be encoded
     2) the combination of keyword letter and phrase letter are used to index  the Vigenere tableau
     3) the indexed letters form the encoded phrase
And the decryption works in reverse, going down the column indexed by the
keyword letter to the encoded letter, and determining which letter heads that
row. Obviously a keyword of all 'a' would not encrypt at all.
The page ends here!

This is the Cailaran Vest, which you've heard of in stories, seen in 
tapestries and paintings, even idly imagined seeking (and finding). It's 
a long green vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and 
flowing to the calves. The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in 
golden thread in a criss-cross pattern. The double-breasted collar is 
embroidered as well, in golden four-pointed stars. It'd look perfect with 
a silk blouse and breeches.
