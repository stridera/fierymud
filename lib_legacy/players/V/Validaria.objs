Smoky quartz is a powerful mystic matrix because it energizes like clear quartz
but also has strong connections to the realms of sleep and dreams.  Mounted in
a silver setting, a pendant like this provides powerful connections to both the
moon and the Reverie, making it highly prized by faeries and witches alike.~

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes are
strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads.  Here and there little
strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form interesting
geometric designs.  This necklace is a charm from the Wizardess Thekra; you
recognize it at once.~

it is imbued with specific energy from the god it is dedicated to.  That

As you bring the staff closer to you, you notice a wind generate around you
almost as though it was protecting you.  The staff makes you feel more
agile, and gives you en energy boost when you hold it!~

This is a very ancient weapon, crafted and enchanted long before your time.  
The head of the hammer is pure mythril, and connects to a haft composed of a
strange black metal.~

extradesc: icicle sharp-icicle
A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a
grip, indicating that it could be used as a weapon.  Whether or not it would be
a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~
