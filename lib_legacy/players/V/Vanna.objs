When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed
hastily with clumsy hands. The teeth vary in shape and size making you
wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

If the scales on this set of scalemail look familiar, perhaps it is because a
master crafstman painstakingly craft each one to resemble one of the scales of
the great black dragon, Sagece.  The scales must have been gathered during a
successful (meaning only several deaths to the party) assault upon her.  Or
perhaps the beauty of the piece of armor just provides motivation for creative
daydreaming.

extradesc: cloak tundra-cloak snowy-white-cloth pile dropped
This finely woven cloak is made of pure white satin with cotton embroidery
marking out an abstract bird symbol on the back which, though it is also in
white, shows up in string light due to the difference in luster between the two
fabrics.  Long ties at the neck can be used to fasten the cloak against the
chill winds of the north.  It looks like it would also make great camoflauge in
the snow.
