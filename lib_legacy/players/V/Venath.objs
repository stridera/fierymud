flaring guard is inlaid with silver skulls so that the poor soul at the

and very dangerous-looking, it would probably cut through a normal pirate sash

looking closely into the depths of the gem you can see the blurry shape of
letters, forming the word "Dakhod".    ~

These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit!  A tie-waist secures them at
the waist, and the thick woolen material goes from there all the way down to
your feet.  They look quite old, and seem to glow with some kind of magical
power.  Perhaps they're enchanted!~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no

surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.~

When placed over the eyes, this extra set of eyes seems to focus one's vision
more, lending detail to even the most plain-seeming objects.  They float in
place magically, synchronizing perfectly with the eyes they are worn over.  
Seems a little odd, but they do help.~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

The gloves each feature 3 long blades originating from the top of the hand.  
When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.    ~

This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.    ~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

This bracelet is actually several very thin golden rings bound together with
gold wire.  It is decorated with fine rose motifs etched into the bands then
embellished with fine yellow citrines and carnelians native to the region
around Solta.  Reflected light glimmers in all directions like a star twinkling
in the night sky.~

Hanging long and billowing, these masterfully woven sleeves ride on the breeze
like clouds on the waves.  A loose pattern of roses typical of Soltan design is
woven into the richly colored fabric.  Gold embroidered trim makes the perfect
final touch to this rich garment.~

These fine elbow-length velvet brocade gloves are woven with golden thread in
the loose rose pattern, iconic of finery from Solta.  Small beryl gems and
pearls are sewn on with small gold settings, adding both weight and beauty.  
They're soft and supple, and lustrous in every way.  They are the perfect gift
for a star of the stage.~

Brocade is a very uncommon material for shoes because of how dirty they can
get.  That makes shoes like these extraordinarily rare.  This pair of slippers
is fine brocade stitched over leather for both comfort and support.  The loose
woven pattern of a Soltan rose is accentuated with golden embroidery and
gemstone beads.  A lavish buckle decorates the face of the shoe.  A small
sensible heel adds just that extra touch of height and composure while still
being possible to walk and dance in.~

These leggings are sublime and flowing, graceful and delicate.  Every sweep of
the leg, every turn of the foot perfectly accentuated, they're ideal for
someone living in the limelight.  A flare at the bottom heightens the movement
and the elegance even more.  They are woven with a prime symbol of high society
and class - a loose representation of the Golden Rose of Solta.~

This vest-like garment is something between a typical doublet and a corset,
ideal as the bodice for a formal gown or the vest of a fancy suit.  The heavy
brocade fabric provides a stiffness and stability a more traditional doublet
lacks without the boning of a full corset.  A loose rose motif typical of
Soltan work is woven in with lustrous threads.  It is trimmed with small pearl
bangles around the bottom and top edges, accentuated with golden fasteners.  
Truly a masterwork garment!~

extradesc: pistol pirate flintlock pirate-pistol dakhod-pistol
This pistol is rougly the size of a child's arm, with a solid silver handle to
grip it by inlaid with skulls and fitting your grip quite comfortably.  The
flintlock itself is clean and looks like it would fire quickly.  The long steel
barrel is slightly stained black from the powder used to fire it.  Such a
weapon would be extremely dangerous if used improperly.  Engraved on one end of
the barrel is the name "Dakhod".    ~
