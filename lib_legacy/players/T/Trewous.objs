This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside
of the ball cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small
sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

The gloves each feature 3 long blades originating from the top of the hand.  
When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.

extradesc: bracers-loong embellished-sapphire-bracers chinese-dragon-bracers
Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....
