This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside
of the ball cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small
sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

extradesc: ring wedding-ring silver-leaves-ring ari-torowa-ring
Beautiful and delicate, this priceless ring has a base of some soft green metal
which is overlaid with an incredibly realistic display of silver leaves.  Each
leaf is different, representing oack, ash, birch, yew, and other trees sacred
to those who hold Nature dear to their hearts.  Intertwining around the leaves
is a delicate vine, representing the unity of those bound by the rings.  
Heartbreaking in its purity, it is nevertheless very sturdy and could probably
withstand the harshest of conditions.

This is an amulet with two breaks in the holding around the large jewel fixed
in the center.  The amulet looks as if it has been molded together and held in
place by some magical force.  The chain is a lushious silver color and the
holder of the bright green gem is a rich golden metal.    
There is a small inscription reading:
A gift to they who completed me.

This thin visor is cast from a mysterious white metal.  Apparently stronger

hanging around the back allows the visor to be worn on the head to protect the
face.  Several vertical slits give the wearer a clear view of the surroundings.

It shifts from left to right, always covering half the face.  It's a light
brown lock of hair, matching seamlessly the hair on the rest of the wearer's

seem like it impairs vision at all.  What is the purpose of such a strange
fashion statement?

      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)

extradesc: qua-jit carapace helm protector
The stony but lightweight carapace of the qua-jit makes for excellent
equipment, as is evident from this helm.  Enchanted with magic that enhances
the wearer's natural visual acuity, a helm like this is often worn by rangers
who have advanced to the highest skills.

extradesc: iridescent bracer protector
Made from a single large shell that must be grown for years, a bracer like this
is given to rangers who have demonstrated their dedication to protecting the
wilderness.  An abalone shell such as the one this is made from would be worth
a fortune on the market, but that value pales in comparison to the magical
enchantments it could contain.

The flute appears to have been whittled by a professional whittler. It's
the perfect replica of a flute, and even sounds good when you make
a terrible attempt at playing it. There's a name carved toward the bottom
of the flute.

These sleeves are made from the thick, warm fur of the glacier beast, known to
dwell in the frozen North.  Made normally to keep the wearer warm, glacier
beast hide is also excellent for enchanting, the strength and fortitude of the
great beasts being used to enhance a normal humanoid's.

These leggings are precisely manufactured of tightly bound fish scales,
pulled together to make very flexible, but very strong armor.  Softly glowing
and humming a nearly inaudible tune, these leggings bring to mind stories of
the sea and of the merfolk that inhabit its depths.  Perhaps there is more to
these seeming fish scales than meets the eye...

In the right light, the studs gleam with pristine grace, adding to their

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

has been enchanted or somehow enhanced, for the balance and strength of
the javelin is superior to any other you have seen.

Thick and woolen, this quilted garment seems like it would keep
you very well protected. It's quite ancient, obviously, though
still servicable. To your modern eyes, the embroidery on it seems
distinctly unwarriorish, but in its day, it must have been an
extraordinary garment.
~
extradesc: embroidery
The needlepointed designs depict fantastic birds and animals amid
twining branches and leaves. It must have taken forever to do it all.
In the corner of the tabard, needlepointed words read:

                  I am my beloved's
               And my beloved is mine.
