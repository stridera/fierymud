   The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is
both too bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

make the clasp circular in form. The ankle-length cloak is lined in black

Hi Thora,

Unfortunately, you need to do the banish and word of command q@0uests before
we can move on to resurrect.  We'll make them easy though.  So here's your
banish quest:

The 'banish' spell is rather obscure, and I had to do a lot
of research to find the ritual that would grant it to you.
To fully understand it, I'll need you to do some research,
too - 15 BOOKs worth.

Once you have learned the ritual, you will need to sacrifice
6 items made of GOLD, and then use a SERRATED blade to take
the lives of 17 animals. Be sure to include 4 COW, 3 GOAT,
a DOVE, a SHEEP, and a RAM, and make the last seven animals
be RABBITs.

Finish this task and the spell 'banish' shall be yours.

-Laoris

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn

this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

From: Laoris

In order to be granted access to the fires of hell for destructive
intent,@0 I will first need preparation of a ritual to ensure your
control of the powers you intend to wield.
 
To this effect, prepare 7 CIRCLEs with 7 FIRE items.  Then fill them
with 3 quantities of BLOOD, and sprinkle some black SAND with a
SACRIFICIAL item.  Hold up an unholy SYMBOL in each hand to invoke
the powers of darkness.
 
Once you have completed this ritual, it will be time to prove your
loyalty.  Seek out and destroy 3 CELESTIAL enemies, a deposed BISHOP,
an ANGEL of darkness, and one of a holy order who has lost his grace.
Lastly, I will need a single item of value: bring me something that
"Kings and queens have sent explorers to their deaths for."
