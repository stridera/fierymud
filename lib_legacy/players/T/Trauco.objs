The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its brightness is nearly
unbearable to look at, but somehow seems to cast a cool glow across the area.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to

a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at

A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.

It reads,
"My thought will be for you
My love will be in you
You are the one to love me
So I will live forever"

A stem of silver with tiny thorns supports a gorgeous bud of sapphire, looking

Inscribed on the stem are tiny holy symbols.

Feather-light silk is artfully sewn into leggings, gathered at the waist and

changing as it is moved and shimmering in the light.  They look like they would
be rather baggy, but comfortable - how not, as they are made of the finest

a pale dragon done in metallic thread shimmering in the light, standing rampant
with a five-taloned foot raised as if in greeting.  The dragon looks, as
dragons tend to, extremely fierce.  Inside the collar in gray thread is the
maker's mark stitched into the fabric, but it is faint enough that it cannot be

extradesc: glass-globe snow-globe snowglobe
As you peer into the globe you can see a courtyard and a tall tower amongst the
snow.  Hang on, little people shapes are MOVING in there.  This is very
disturbing!  When shaken, the snow inside flutters around madly, but the little
people seem unaffected.

extradesc: invisible coif assassin
Made out of pure shadow, a coif like this allows the wearer to do more than
hide; they gain the senses of the shadows themselves.  Prized by rogues and
assassins alike, a coif like this is rarely found, but given to a person who
has advanced to the highest ranks in their guild.
