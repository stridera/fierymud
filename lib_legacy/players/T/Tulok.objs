   These pants are made out of a satiny material that feels soft and smooth,
cold on the outside but comfortable when worn.  Large pockets should have
enough room in them for as many oddments as one could desire, and a thin
drawstring at the wait insures that they should fit anyone.  Given their
shimmering appearance and comfortable fit, it is almost certain they are
magical in nature.

themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

extradesc: necklace hand carved hand-carved-necklace wood wooden
The necklace's main pendant is carved in the shape of a tree. The tree
appears to be growing...can this be? You notice at the bottom of the
necklace that you can see the trees' rings...you count 50. On the side of
the tree there appears to be an inscription.

The vial is about as large as a troll's pinky and made of fine crystal,
stoppered with wax and lead.  The liquid inside is a dark red, somewhere
between old blood and pomegranate juice.  The quality of craftmanship seems
very high, much higer than you would expect from such a primitive people.

The leather is pale grey, very supple, and thin.  The silver trim is painted on
in long, quick strokes.  No symbols or drawings adorn the spine or cover; only
faint wrinkles criscross the leather.
