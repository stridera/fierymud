extradesc: memento lover's lovers lovers-soul soul locket platinum
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    
~

It reads,
"My thought will be for you
My love will be in you
You are the one to love me

So light it seems made out of cloud rather than fabric, the silk has been dyed
a dark blue and covered with dragonfly embroidery.  Looking closer, it seems
that the dark blue kimono is only the outermost of three layers - inside it are
a light blue and white kimono.  No wonder it can be used as armor!

The dragonflies are swen on to the silk with a combination of silk and metallic
thread.  Bodies of iridescent green and wings of silver are outlined in a
simple black on the deep blue of the kimono.
