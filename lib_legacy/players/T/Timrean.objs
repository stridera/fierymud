A shiny disc of polished steel makes the main part of this piece of armor.
Tooled across its edges with a scrolling design, everything about it, from
the subtle decorations to the fine straps, makes it look expensive and
highly effective. There are only a few little dents in its surface to mar
its mirror-like perfection.

This simple little iron helm is made almost completely without
ornamentation, aside from very simple tooling along its edge. 
Leather straps hold it onto its wearer's head. It's also quite
heavy and probably very hot!

black iron.

extradesc: iron boots
This is one heavy pair of boots! Black iron strips are bolted to a pair  
of black leather boots, making them immensely protective as well as
cumbersome. They are unornamented, though they do bear some light dents,
testimony to their usefulness.

little safe.
