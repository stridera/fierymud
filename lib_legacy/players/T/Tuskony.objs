These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!
     (Hint : you need something to write on...then
      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)~

This staff is about three and a half feet long.  It is designed for wielding
with one hand, and is usually employed by mage's for its light weight.  The
wood used to craft it is of fine quality, though it remained unpolished.~
