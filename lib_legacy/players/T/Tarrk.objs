   An ancient form of weapon similar to a maul, the goremaul is set with tiny

handle is silver with a worn, white leather grip and the head of the goremaul
is inlaid with orichalcum, a rare alloy of gold that is said to be especially
effective against evil creatures.  The weapon hums slightly with a not
unpleasant buzz, constantly reminding someone that it is there.  At the base of
the grip is a holy symbol.

extradesc: jerky turkey strip meat dried food
This is a stringy bit of meat.  It looks like someone marinated and smoked it a
bit to give it flavor and to preserve it.  It's not much of a morsel, but
better than nothing.

This armor is so light that you wonder that it could be at all effective!
Made from strips of bamboo cleverly lashed together with wire, it covers
from the throat to the knees. It looks like it ties in the back.~
