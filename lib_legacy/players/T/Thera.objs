extradesc: greyish stone ring hematite hematite-ring
Though it looks like metal, this ring is actually made out of the lustrous
stone hematite.  It is slightly more brittle than a metal ring and very cool to
the touch.  It looks like it would fit a slender finger better than a thick one
- it would be a shame to have such a nice ring shatter.

A sphere of pure unlaced darkness.  The casing around it appears to be clear,
letting the the view inside be known.  Black clouds seem to be moving within
the orb, lighting threads around violently.  It is its own world of chaos.
