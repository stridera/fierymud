This is the ring of a God, granted to one who has shown great courage and
fortitude in retrieving items of certain value.  The Lord Tanle has, however
reserved the right to call on the wearer of this ring if and when it suits his
purpose, or may repossess the ring at any time.  The ring is a slender platinum
band of rare, uncalculatable value with a small, pink, white, blue, green, and
purple stone laid in the top.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

The mask is smooth to the touch, yet no highlights are visible on its surface.
Its color is that of the deepest black.  Expressionless ovals allow its wearer
to see, and small openings assist with breathing, but no other feature is
visible.  Indeed, it appears to float in front of its wearer's face with no
means of support.

Yeah yeah, I'm a horses ass...  I'm busy, so sue me?  :P Anyways...  I thin@0k
for tanle's ring of pride I'll give you the same sort of same quest I gave
to Elron.  Guess what...  It's a spelling bee!

For Tanle's Ring of Pride, please trophy-spell PRETTYSHINYTHINGS
One of those S's has to be Sagece.
The R has to be Raibeart of the Dance.
One of those N's has to be Norhamen.

I think that's sufficient for this quest. :) Good luck with the other letters.

Crafted from black snakeskin stretched over a light wooden frame and thick wool
stuffing, this little dragon doll looks very similar to a real live dragon,
only magnitudes smaller.  An air of death surrounds even this small doll, and a
look in its red gleaming glass eyes is as vile and black as its scales.

Hey Tugzilla,
I'm still having trouble logging into the mud server, so for@0 now just
ignore the boa constrictor in your trophy.  If I can get in, I'll remove
the trophy entry, but if not we'll just ignore it for the quest.  Good
luck.

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.

If enough people respond Me "Ramah" via Mud Mail with an interest in a leveling quest like the 
Triathlon that Laoris had a few years back. I have agreed to host it.
The Rules are Simple.
You start at level 1, with as many characters as you many want.
You can NOT have any help at all from your alts, This Includs
*ITEMS, WEAPONS, POTIONS, SCROLLS, MONEY and other things along that same spirit
(even from characters of equal or lesser level)
*GROUPING (with any nonquester of any higher level than any quester in the group)
*ANY magical or nonmagical support corpse returns, moonwells, corpse shifts, or buffs
of any kind from nonquesters of a higher level
This MUD-WIDE quest will go for 1 week. 
The winner of this quest will be the play with the highest level.
If the levels are the same, then the one with the most on there xp Bar
IE. <====--------------------------*----------------------------->
Other prizes will be given for best dressed, fastest leveler among other things 
Anyone caught cheating will not be rewarded for the quest  
I expect you to self police with the rules

extradesc: white dragon scale white-dragon-scale
About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn

this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.

the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this

leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for

A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking

between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort

stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

This is the Cailaran Vest, which you've heard of in stories, seen in

a long green vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and 
flowing to the calves. The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in 
golden thread in a criss-cross pattern. The double-breasted collar is 
embroidered as well, in golden four-pointed stars. It'd look perfect with 
a silk blouse and breeches.

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.
