There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.

extradesc: bracers-loong embellished-sapphire-bracers chinese-dragon-bracers
Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

This beautiful cloak is made of some kind of silky white fabric

white feather has a single dark blue dot near its tip, giving
the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to
dappled. The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body, with
a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically

in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

From: Laoris

Siah, pupil of the magicks:
 
Your humble petition was a welcome reprieve@0
From the endless demands of those more naive.
Yet my station requires me to be just
So for your request a real challenge is a must.
 
To cast the storms of a celestial event
You must contest the bodies of the sky's extent
Confront the ASTRAL and five CELESTIALs,
Then two GODDESSes and four ANGELs for your trials.
 
Traverse the night skies and collect from them four STARs,
And then gather thirty lights from here to Mars.
Some may be unwilling without brutal fights,
So show you mean business: slay two SUNs and three LIGHTs.
 
-Laoris, Blargh

A slight change to your quest: I'll only need three STAR items
instead of @0four.

Good luck,

Distinguished wizard Siah:

The sight of the gods requires the orderly sa@0crifice of many lives,
which you may demonstrate by spelling OMNISCIENTMAGICSPELL upon your
trophy.  However, no players lives are to be taken as a part of this
process.  Then to complete the sacrifice, return to me with 5 EYEs
that I may choose the one most appropriate to form into your wizard
eye.

Laoris

The javelin is made of brass and at first glance appears to be an inferior
weapon. However, a close inspection of the weapon reveals that the metal
has been enchanted or somehow enhanced, for the balance and strength of
the javelin is superior to any other you have seen.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap

it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this

extradesc: barbed-dagger dagger-narrow-barbed-blade
The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.

extradesc: bracers-loong embellished-sapphire-bracers chinese-dragon-bracers
Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

It's a simple rectangular piece of expensive greenish sea-silk.  The shawl
offers no real protection from the elements or from physical attacks, but it
seems to be blessed by the sea's spirit.
