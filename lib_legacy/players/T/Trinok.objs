These cups fit exactly around their wearer's shoulder, protecting it from the
all-too-frequent blows that break through a fighter's defenses.  They're plain,
with only an embossing around their edges as decoration.  Leather straps hold
the spaulders tight against the shoulders and down part of the arm,
criss-crossing at the chest and back.

This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.

This fruit is about the size of a plum, with a hard rind that,
once broken, reveals sweet, nearly alcoholic-tasting orange-pink
flesh. Though it isn't large, fruit is supposed to be very good
for growing adventurers, so eat up!
