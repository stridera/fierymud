A small ball of light glows from an unknown source, but somehow still

necklace, except for the small glint of light that emits tiny beams that 
illuminate the palm of your hand.  Occasionally the light grows brighter for 
an instant, then fades back to normal.  ~

This is the Cailaran Vest, which you've heard of in stories, seen in tapestries

vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and flowing to the calves.
The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in golden thread in a criss-cross
pattern.  The double-breasted collar is embroidered as well, in golden
four-pointed stars.  It'd look perfect with a silk blouse and breeches.~

hanging around the back allows the visor to be worn on the head to protect the

fur, preventing the frigid white metal from touching skin.  The plate metal is
slightly curved and much thinner than average steel, undoubtedly created by
some uncomprehensible elven miracle.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully

elliptical pupil in the middle.  This tattoo gives the bearer the look of an
archetypical beast, combining intricately detailed scales, elaborate feathers,
and ridged horns along the temples.  Bold colors, reds, blues, greens, golds,
burst out of the design to emphasize power and strength.  The ink is infused
with the blood of the greatest beasts from all across Ethilien.  Infused with
such power, the tattoo causes the bearer's eyes to burn with a fierce inner
light, piercing the dark with fiery determination.~

This sword's easily the length of your entire arm, and the blade itself is
thick and wide, with a blood groove deeply etched into its center.  It's
clearly incredibly old.  You just can't find this kind of workmanship these
days.~

A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a
grip, indicating that it could be used as a weapon.  Whether or not it would be
a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~

this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

Made from a single large shell that must be grown for years, a bracer like this
is given to rangers who have demonstrated their dedication to protecting the
wilderness.  An abalone shell such as the one this is made from would be worth
a fortune on the market, but that value pales in comparison to the magical
enchantments it could contain.~

This breed of griffin is both very rare and highly regarded for its
natural magical properties, making a tunic like this nearly priceless.
In the right light, the studs gleam with pristine grace, adding to their
beauty and wonder.~

These leggings are precisely manufactured of tightly bound fish scales,
pulled together to make very flexible, but very strong armor.  Softly glowing
and humming a nearly inaudible tune, these leggings bring to mind stories of
the sea and of the merfolk that inhabit its depths.  Perhaps there is more to
these seeming fish scales than meets the eye...~

extradesc: tailfeather parrot's-tailfeather tail-feather bright-green-feather pen quill
Looking rather tattered, this long tailfeather is too beat-up to look good in a
hat.  It seems sturdy enough to use as a pen, though.~

extradesc: blade bright-white-blade
This blade shines with a bright light whenever it is in the presence of 
something or someone good.  It is used by the Undead Lord to protect his
mausoleum and afterlife.  Being so white it is difficult to perceive exactly
where the edges are, so I'd be careful with it.~

extradesc: tabard-heroes thick-woolen-tabard wool
Thick and woolen, this quilted garment seems like it would keep you very well
protected.  It's quite ancient, obviously, though still servicable.  To your
modern eyes, the embroidery on it seems distinctly unwarriorish, but in its
day, it must have been an extraordinary garment.~
extradesc: embroidery
The needlepointed designs depict fantastic birds and animals amid
twining branches and leaves. It must have taken forever to do it all.
In the corner of the tabard, needlepointed words read:

                  I am my beloved's
               And my beloved is mine.~

extradesc: flaming-sword longsword blue-flame long-sword
This mighty sword was the prized possession of the Lizard King, ruler of the
Great Northern Swamp.  Forged from mythril and enchanted in the depths of the
castle beneath the swamp, the sword was created to bring fire to the darkest of
places and burn all enemies before it.  It is truly a staggering weapon to
behold!~

extradesc: barbed-dagger dagger-narrow-barbed-blade
The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.~
