This is the ring of a God, granted to one who has shown great courage and
fortitude in retrieving items of certain value.  The Lord Tanle has, however
reserved the right to call on the wearer of this ring if and when it suits his
purpose, or may repossess the ring at any time.  The ring is a slender platinum
band of rare, uncalculatable value with a small, pink, white, blue, green, and
purple stone laid in the top.

Rather simplistic in design, the spectacles have a wire thin framing of some

ears.  Through magic enchantment, the symmetrical lenses have been tinted a

The book is leatherbound. It's quite old, obviously. When you open it,
a cloud of fine dust flies up, tickling your nose and stinging your eyes. 
Each of the yellowed, crumbling pages is written in the same crabbed, 
faltering handwriting. It's quite difficult to read, but you puzzle it 
out slowly. A Table of Contents says that the thin volume contains five 
separate letters. It is divided into sections by a beautiful coloured 
painting bound right into the book.
  You can look at section1, section2, section3, section4, or section5. 
~
extradesc: section1
This page's facing page features a beautiful illumined picture of a man
facing a large group of demonic creatures. He holds up his glowing hands
and seems to have no fear at all in his face. The text reads:

  I have been traveling our realm for many years, and find myself
  falling to anger at the blatant slap in the face issued to the
  Order of Mielikki by Blackmourne's minions. Now, I know, being an
  old priest who has been fighting Evil for many years, that I should
  exercise discretion, that this will pass. But somehow, this latest
  assault on our charter feels different, and I have no confidence
  that the Gods of our land will protect us this time from the
  Archenemy.

  Morpheous, one of our patron gods, has been molding us for many
  years under the tutelage of the wise Kaaz clan. I suppose it is
  inevitable that our society, so deftly ruled and so wisely shepherded,
  would become a cause for jealousy. In my prayers, I have sensed the
  hatred and envy of the foul god Blackmourne. I pray he does not raise
  his hand against the world -- for if he does, who can stop a god?
  Not even the Kaaz clan could stand against all the evil a god may
  cause.

  Be ready for anything. The call to defend our gracious Goddess
  may come at any time, and we must not allow Blackmourne to prevail.


                                In Yr. Service
                                Girr'Kaaz, High Priest of Mielikki

extradesc: section2
This section is faced with a picture of a decayed, disgusting human 
figure wearing a long, black silk robe. His face reveals no trace of 
normal human gentleness and kindness -- the cloak of his many years hangs 
very heavy on him. He's pure evil. The text on the next page reads:

  I have been traveling our realm for many years, my brothers and
  sisters in the faith, and I know that my learning is as yet not
  complete. However, bear with the words of one who is still learning:

  HOW can the Lord of Templace not demand the head of Ruin Wormheart
  on a golden plate? How can he not see the perfidy and cruelty of this
  supposed priest? Every day brings a new rumour and a new crime, and
  every day we see more of those vile Undead Knights coming into our
  beautiful cities. Wormheart is daring us to do something, my brothers.
  I pray none of us acts before the right time has come.

  Merely by reading the words of Ruin Wormheart's missives, one may
  get a feeling for the hatred of this person and those around him.
  He cloaks these evil, vile feelings in words of sweetness and light,
  but none of those who worship the Goddess can fail to see the truth.

  My warnings, brothers and sisters: Do not fall prey to this guild,
  and do not allow Ruin to provoke you... Yet. Our time will come, and
  we will wipe this degenerate guild from the face of the earth!

                                In Yr. Service

extradesc: section3
This section begins with a picture of the dwarven city, Anduin. The
city's walls are in ruins; warriors, both human and not, fight for
their very lives against a monstrous horde of demonic creatures. The
text of the message reads:

  Brethren,

  I have traveled this realm for many years now, and I hope that
  you all know me well enough to know that I would not waste your
  time without good reason or without just cause. 

  But this latest outrage demands our immediate attention! Those
  who can, journey to the twin cities at greatest haste. Those who
  cannot... Please favour your brethren with prayer and supplication.
  We will have to make our stand, and we will have to be victorious,
  or else our Guild will be wiped from the face of the earth.

  The demons that Blackmourne has called forth have already destroyed
  the city of the priests, and they have their eyes on the entire known
  world. We must act now, or we will lose the crowning city of the
  known realm to the foul creatures beyond the rift. Blackmourne has
  gained an ally in the equally evil god Angus, and together, their
  efforts in creating a rift between the demon plane, Gaar'laxxil, and
  our own has shaken the very foundations of our world. The demons know
  that should they win this war, they will feast on the fruits of our
  very world. What folly have we bred in endeavouring to create good!

                                In Yr. Service
                                Girr'Kaaz, High Priest of Mielikki

extradesc: section4
This last section begins with a barely-colored painting of what must
be the City of Templace in its glory years. You recognize the Bronze
Golems and the huge gates immediately. In front of it are three human
figures, facing two huge humanoid figures. And above the two huge men
flies the biggest dragon you have ever seen... The text of the letter
reads:

  My brethren, I write to you with unfortunate news. I was in the
  city when the greatest atrocity of our age occurred, and it is with
  the heaviest of hearts that I pass these words on to you. Templace
  is destroyed, and it can never be rebuilt, and the devastation to
  the nearby area will never be undone!

  Angus and Blackmourne opened a rift in the very fabric of this plane, 
  bringing forth horrors from beyond it that no one's mind could 
  comprehend. But our fair Templace stood strong through all the 
  attacks. In desperation, they called forth the great black dragon
  Sagece from the Plane of Gaar'laxxil. As the beast stepped through
  the rift, her delicate foot-claws grazed the surface of the lake near
  Templace, and it turned black as coal in that moment.

  Our leaders, the great Kaaz clan, defied the assembled evils of the
  very gods, but the great dragon had help of the vilest sort -- from
  the direct hand of Blackmourne himself. Girr'Kaaz's power was such that
  without Blackmourne's aid, Sagece could never have defeated him. 
  Morpheous was deeply saddened by the destruction of his high priest, but
  imagine his horror when he went to claim the body, and saw that a wound  
  that could only have come from the blade of his own godly brother! He
  wept, my brethren. Morpheous disappeared from view with the sorry
  remains of our leader. I do not know what will happen now, but the
  skies seem to be holding their breaths. Pray, my brethren.

                                In Yr. Service
                                Elythaz, Cardinal of Templace-that-was 

~
extradesc: section5
These pages of the book face a painting, beautifully rendered, of 
some sort of aerial explosion on a scale unimaginable to mortal eyes.
The text, written in a spidery script, reads:

  My brethren, there is again peace in our land, but at such a cost I
  hesitate to relay the story to you, for fear you will think I have
  taken leave of my senses.

  The All-Father himself, Metamorpho, appeared out of swirling mists
  when the city of Templace was destroyed. He was burning with the most
  holy wrath one can imagine, as terrible as an army with banners. He
  took up Morpheus, Blackmourne, and Angus, and all was quiet, save for
  the cries of the wounded. I tried my best to heal whom I could, but my
  strength was nearly gone. Like everybody on the field -- demon, human,
  and victim alike -- I carefully watched for the gods' return.

  When they did return, our gracious lord Morpheous, still holding the
  broken body of our Girr'Kaaz, performed a rite none have ever seen.
  Elia was furious that she could not perform the funeral rites, but
  she loves Morpheous as much as a human heart can love a god, so she
  allowed Morpheous to set his binding upon the world. The sky sparkled
  both with the power of the enchantment, and with the presence of many
  other gods, some of whom were newborn, some old and dear presences.
  They put their seal upon the ceremony. When it was over, Girr'Kaaz's 
  body turned to a kind of faerie-light that scattered all over the
  world. I write you only what I have seen, brethren.

  The gods did disappear just afterward, though I think Morpheous gazed
  upon the battlefield a short while. The Kaaz clan, what was left of it,
  scattered as well. I have not seen any of them since the battle.

  So that is where we are now, my brethren. Our mission is to rebuild
  this sorely shattered world and finish erasing the evils brought here
  by those whose greed nearly shattered everything we hold dear. If you
  happen to meet one of the Kaaz, do not alarm them, but report their
  movements to the Guild. I pray for their mental healing.

                          In Yr. Service,
                          Ausentharn, A Priest of the Northlands

Title: The Lost Library of Shiran
Author: Karlix the Omniscient

"...and a great civilization rose and prospered.  They achieved such
wealth and status and they did not want the knowledge they had gathered
and strove for to be lost to succeeding generations.  So they built a great
library on an island off the coast of their great city.  Into this library
they placed all the knowledge they had gathered over the centuries.  Great
tomes about life, mythical creatures, far away and mythical lands, great
items of magic, etc, etc.  Such was the knowledge that they possessed that
it is rumored the gods got jealous and deemed the information kept in that
library too great for mortal minds.  And so, it is rumored it was the
gods who destroyed the Library and with it all the knowledge kept
therein..."

extradesc: boots lightweight-brown-boots stained-leather-boots pair
These boots are made of lightweight brown leather. Reinforcement around
the toe and heel provides some protection, but they are better at enhancing
agility than stopping sword-blows.

extradesc: doll miniature-mysa-doll cloudy-hued-dragon-doll
This fierce-looking dragon doll is small and toylike, but not terribly cute
with its mottled grey reptilian hide and dull eyes.  The underbelly is a softer
white fuzzy cloth, contrasting the doll's pointed metal claws, odd for a
child's plaything.  A small pile of copper coins is glued together, resting
under the doll's belly.

hey Tanle good to hear from you
You are always welcome back anytime.
Thin@0gs are small scale compared to what we used to be, but we do
still have a few dedicated players.
The knowledge you have is still pretty valid, so that's always
a help too.  
Stop by any time, share ideas the gods@fierymud email address till works,
if you're interested in getting back in, I can add your email address
to the list that gets those emails.

Have a good one!
Chinok / Eric

Greetings My old Friend
It has indeed been a very long time.  You have bee@0n missed.  I am afraid That Sata has grown up, and is working about 60 hours a week and I never see him either.
I usually play mid afternoon and from 7-9pm eastern time
I do hope to see you soon.
luv,
Ann

lol yep, that phrase is needed after the cervasas (bano)
yep, I guess I'm @0sole owner at this point.  Zzur swings in from time to time, 
but maybe 2-3 times a year.
enjoyed mexico is a strong way to put it, I was in down-town mexico city, really not a lot of fun there. WAY crowded. 
good to see you here, come hang out whenever,   Summer is always slow-time, 
we've seen 5 actual players on at once (yeah, I remember before the crash it would
hit 100 back in the day
enjoy!

SURe, sounds great
I'll cover my ass and say -- contract is one line.
for@0 every $10,000 in sales, I get $100 
if you don't make $10,000,  you owe me nothing.
Write away and let me know if you need any help.
THANKS!
Eric
