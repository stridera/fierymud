  The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand. It seems to light up
the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

The leather straps at the top and bottom of each plate are much longer than
they should be, allowing each to be wrapped around the entire leg once, then
tightened and tied off.  Such an armor style is very unique and actually
functions fairly well as armor, as well as being a reflection of the simplicity
of monastic life.

extradesc: ice eyes magical pair two
As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically
strong, for though it is very old, there are no dents, dings, or scratches
in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

Unwilling to be dislodged, the vines have actually grown into and through the
wood of this helm.  The helm itself appears to have been formed naturally, with
very little if any human alteration.  Powerful natural magic emanates from this
helm, indicating that it is more than what it seems.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.
