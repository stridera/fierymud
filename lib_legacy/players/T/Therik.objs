Though it looks like metal, this ring is actually made out of the lustrous
stone hematite.  It is slightly more brittle than a metal ring and very cool to
the touch.  It looks like it would fit a slender finger better than a thick one
- it would be a shame to have such a nice ring shatter.~

This breastplate is made of steel and obsidian.  The breastplate itself is made
of strong steel and is coated with razor sharp obsidian to make it look nice.
It edges are flied down so you don't hurt yourself while wearing this heavy
breastplate.  Its thickness shows that it would be very hard to penetrate with
any weapon.  As you look at the face of the breastplate you see a carving of a
blackthorn, the symbol of the dark monks.    ~

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.    ~

making you realise that this must be a book of power.  One of its stories tells
of a visit from a band of powerful sorcerers who were impressed with Neris'
kindness and presented her with a holy scarab that has some power to it.  The
leader of the sorcerers is shown speaking aloud to Neris refering to her as
"Neris'Kaan", or "Neris the Kind".~

Large and made of a blackened metal, this dagger looks like it was made for the
hands of something larger than human.  Its leather grip is bloodstained but
comfortable, and it looks like it has been replaced more than once.  Its pommel
is a crystal of the colorful, rare mineral thawkinixa.    ~
