A simple vest protects the vicera from, lets say, unwanted intrusion.  Its
light construction also allows for easier and unhindered movement.~

extradesc: emblazoned-baldric large-ornamented-belt leather
This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.~

extradesc: tasseled-hood crumpled fabric
The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over time, the color
was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light brown.  It's a simple two-piece
conical sort of hood, coming to a point well above the wearer's crown and
falling back.  A lively tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.~
