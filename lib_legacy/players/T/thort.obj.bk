This breastplate is somewhat small, likely designed for an elf or slender
human.  It is formed from a strange metal, ice-cold to the touch, yet not
melting in heat.  The plate is much thinner than steel, not even as thick as
most swords.  A series of leather straps on the back may be tied together to
hold the breastplate on.~

hanging around the back allows the visor to be worn on the head to protect the
face.  Several vertical slits give the wearer a clear view of the surroundings.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  This tattoo gives the bearer the look of an
archetypical beast, combining intricately detailed scales, elaborate feathers,
and ridged horns along the temples.  Bold colors, reds, blues, greens, golds,
burst out of the design to emphasize power and strength.  The ink is infused
with the blood of the greatest beasts from all across Ethilien.  Infused with
such power, the tattoo causes the bearer's eyes to burn with a fierce inner
light, piercing the dark with fiery determination.~

a silver setting, a pendant like this provides powerful connections to both the
moon and the Reverie, making it highly prized by faeries and witches alike.~

shaft is made of wood, with two sections wrapped in thongs. The blade is
quite long and similar in shape to a scimitar. It protrudes out from the
shaft quite some distance, then rounds back towards it in a vicious curve.
Overall, it seems like quite a clumsy weapon, but wielded properly, it
could do great damage.~

extradesc: pendant ice-crystal-pendant hexagonal-crystal
A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.~

An airy-light robe of the finest silk shimmers and shines in the light,
reflecting many colors that change as it is moved.  Every color in the rainbow
is represented here and there, though if the fabric is moved the colors shift
again.  It looks like it is all made of one solid piece of fabric, hemmed only
at the collar and the sleeves.  It looks like it would be loose but comfortable
to wear.~

A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a
grip, indicating that it could be used as a weapon.  Whether or not it would be
a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~

The flower resembles a perfect looking daisy, and is yellow in color.
The flower smells good enough to eat, and just looking at it makes you
kind of hungry. The more you study the flower, the more it looks like
some type of magical food, rather than a real flower. ~

A small ball of light glows from an unknown source, but somehow still remains

for the small glint of light that emits tiny beams that illuminate the palm of
your hand.  Occasionally the light grows brighter for an instant, then fades
back to normal.~

It is very old and shows the marks from years of use.  The stone beads are
cracked and worn down on the edges and a few of them have chipped apart.  The
gold beads are starting to tarnish and fade, almost matching the dull luster of
the stone, from prolonged contact with the sweat from the skin.~

The pinnacle of a warrior's progress is recognized in this chestplate.  So
rarely does a warrior complete his journey to becoming a champion, no expense
is spared when creating a chestplate like this.  Powerful magics enhance the
already superior craftsmanship of this dwarven steel plate, which bears the bas
relief of a lion's head.  Each is eye represented by a flawless emerald, and
rare chimera hide is used to tie up the back.~

of battle and war depicting continuous central figure, these vambraces are a
sign of a true warrior's prowess.  Each vambrace covers the entire forearm from
elbow to wrist and wraps completely around the forearm, providing excellent

Forged from the finest dwarven steel and strongly enchanted, this helm
increases not only an already mighty warrior's strength, but also his mental
faculties.  Bold in line and form, but clean and somewhat complex in overall
appearance, this helm is a reminder that to be a champion means having a quick
and strong brain to match an already mighty form.~

Crafted from a solid shard of hardened night, the ring refuses to let even
light caress it.  The band is thin yet does not seem weak by far.  A small
place at the top feels very thick and round.  At a straight look it is almost
like one could see movement from inside.~

As best as you can tell, this instrument is a harp of some kind.  It is
C-shaped, like the stave of a bow, with the wide mouth of the arc completely
open.  The bottom of the arc is a fat, wide base, anchoring 16 strings which
run from base to midsection of the harp.  It is lacquered black, capped on each
end with gold, and highly decorated with cords which help tighten and tune the
strings.~

A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

making you realise that this must be a book of power.  One of its stories tells
of a visit from a band of powerful sorcerers who were impressed with Neris'
kindness and presented her with a holy scarab that has some power to it.  The
leader of the sorcerers is shown speaking aloud to Neris refering to her as
"Neris'Kaan", or "Neris the Kind".~
