  The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand. It seems to light up
the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

extradesc: bracers-loong embellished-sapphire-bracers chinese-dragon-bracers
Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

extradesc: necklace hand carved hand-carved-necklace wood wooden
The necklace's main pendant is carved in the shape of a tree. The tree
appears to be growing...can this be? You notice at the bottom of the
necklace that you can see the trees' rings...you count 50. On the side of
the tree there appears to be an inscription.

extradesc: mask black
This is a very simple mask made out of some black cloth.  It's only purpose is
to cover the face so no one can see who is under it.  It conceals the whole
head and some of the neck and only leaves spaces for the eyes and mouth.  As
you look inside the mask you see a small tag that is almost completely hidden
from view.
