This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.  It is
enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside of the ball
cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small sun, radiating
bright light in all directions.  If you have this item, luck, determination and
the Gods are with you.~

extradesc: ring wedding-ring silver-leaves-ring ari-torowa-ring
Beautiful and delicate, this priceless ring has a base of some soft green metal
which is overlaid with an incredibly realistic display of silver leaves.  Each
leaf is different, representing oack, ash, birch, yew, and other trees sacred
to those who hold Nature dear to their hearts.  Intertwining around the leaves
is a delicate vine, representing the unity of those bound by the rings.  
Heartbreaking in its purity, it is nevertheless very sturdy and could probably
withstand the harshest of conditions.    ~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully

archetypical beast, combining intricately detailed scales, elaborate feathers,
and ridged horns along the temples.  Bold colors, reds, blues, greens, golds,
burst out of the design to emphasize power and strength.  The ink is infused
with the blood of the greatest beasts from all across Ethilien.  Infused with
such power, the tattoo causes the bearer's eyes to burn with a fierce inner
light, piercing the dark with fiery determination.~

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.~

The mallet is made entirely of metal. The black surface of the mallet

slightly unwieldly in combat, would make an effective crushing weapon.~

Thick and woolen, this quilted garment seems like it would keep you very well
protected.  It's quite ancient, obviously, though still servicable.  To your
modern eyes, the embroidery on it seems distinctly unwarriorish, but in its
day, it must have been an extraordinary garment.~
extradesc: embroidery
The needlepointed designs depict fantastic birds and animals amid
twining branches and leaves. It must have taken forever to do it all.
In the corner of the tabard, needlepointed words read:

                  I am my beloved's
               And my beloved is mine.~

A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a

a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~
