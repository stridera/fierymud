You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

a warm feeling, though there is no actual heat coming from it.  It is about the
size of an ogre's clenched fist and is heavy but feels hollow rather than
solid.~

An ancient form of weapon similar to a maul, the goremaul is set with tiny
barbs at the head to cause ripping damage along with the usual bludgeon.  Its
handle is silver with a worn, white leather grip and the head of the goremaul
is inlaid with orichalcum, a rare alloy of gold that is said to be especially
effective against evil creatures.  The weapon hums slightly with a not
unpleasant buzz, constantly reminding someone that it is there.  At the base of
the grip is a holy symbol.~
