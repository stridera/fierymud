Upon the pate of some hapless bird it must have been beautifully expressive,
as the crest itself would swing up or lie back against the bird's head to
express interest, excitement, fear, and love.  Holding the feathered garment in
your hands, you cannot help but feel sorry for the bird and wonder if you might
be able to recreate even a degree of its vitality.

     Made of a thin, stretchy material lined with a warm layer of fuzzy down,
these sleeves would be perfect for keeping your arms warm beneath your
overcoat.  However, the thin material would provide little benefit for warriors
and might seem even a bit sissified for the more beastly of occupations.  The
thin material has enough stretch to it that you might even be able to wear the
sleeves about your legs like a pair of tights in a stretch (no pun intended!)

examination, the cloak looks to be made up of a long cape and two wings
attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.

     The beak of a parrot, this grey hook-shaped bill has razor-sharp edges
honed daily by its former owner.  Though most birds are not aggressive, only
the most foolhardy would not look to its own defense.  It looks as if someone
has drilled two holes in the sides of the beak and run a leather thong through
them so that you could tie the hookbill onto your head; it might also function
well as a kind of dagger in hand.

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.

     Made of a thin, stretchy material lined with a warm layer of fuzzy down,
these sleeves would be perfect for keeping your arms warm beneath your
overcoat.  However, the thin material would provide little benefit for warriors
and might seem even a bit sissified for the more beastly of occupations.  The
thin material has enough stretch to it that you might even be able to wear the
sleeves about your legs like a pair of tights in a stretch (no pun intended!)

extradesc: droppings nasty bit bird
     Yech!  Though the birds within the aviary's walls are far from
domesticated - much less housebroken - happening upon such a nasty bit of
droppings is an unpleasant surprise; generally the aviary grounds crew seem to
do a pretty good job keeping the paths clean, turning such offal into the soil
to act as fertilizer for the exotic plant life.
     The core of the droppings is a greenish-grey snakelike solid, surrounded
by an off-white liquid that is quickly drying in the sun.  Though bird
droppings do not have the disgusting smell of other animal feces, they are
still rather repulsive nonetheless.

     These fine pants are made of a light fabric to which are sewn hundreds of
soft feathers.  The plumage looks to have come from all sorts of birds, with
long blue and green feathers likely from parrots lined up beside the smaller
browns, whites,  and greys of birds like finches and budgerigars.  Though their
value as armor might be questionable, the breeches do look to be rather warm
and even comfortable - and a must-have for every dandy's wardrobe!

This beautifully curving feather is a deep royal blue, just like the kingfisher
it comes from.  It's a primary flight feather from the left wing, so it would
probably make an excellent writing pen.
