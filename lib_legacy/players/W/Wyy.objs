This is the feather of a large vulture.  The feather itself is quite ugly and

This dagger has been made with an exceptional craftsmanship as the handle is
hardened wood inlaid with jewels and gold that glistens in the light.  The
blade shimmers with a radiant light, reflecting the smallest amounts of light
that hit it.~
