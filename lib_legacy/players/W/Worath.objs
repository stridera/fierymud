This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully

elliptical pupil in the middle.  This tattoo gives the bearer the look of an
archetypical beast, combining intricately detailed scales, elaborate feathers,
and ridged horns along the temples.  Bold colors, reds, blues, greens, golds,
burst out of the design to emphasize power and strength.  The ink is infused
with the blood of the greatest beasts from all across Ethilien.  Infused with
such power, the tattoo causes the bearer's eyes to burn with a fierce inner
light, piercing the dark with fiery determination.~

This warm, large garment is tailored entirely from feathers.  Upon closer
examination, the cloak looks to be made up of a long cape and two wings
attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.~

the same time, you get a strange sensation of burning and freezing.~

Smoky quartz is a powerful mystic matrix because it energizes like clear quartz
but also has strong connections to the realms of sleep and dreams.  Set in
silver, a ring like this provides powerful connections to both the moon and the
Reverie, making it highly prized by faeries and witches alike.~

A small ball of light glows from an unknown source, but somehow still remains
attached to a shining platinum chain.  It looks like a common necklace, except
for the small glint of light that emits tiny beams that illuminate the palm of
your hand.  Occasionally the light grows brighter for an instant, then fades
back to normal.~

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.~

About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.~

Oregano is a rather mild herb used to add zest to otherwise plain dishes.  It
is said to help in restoration spells and help someone with chronic weakness
gain strength.  It goes well in tomato sauces with basil and garlic.    ~

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some

large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

The book is leatherbound. It's quite old, obviously. When you open it,
a cloud of fine dust flies up, tickling your nose and stinging your eyes. 
Each of the yellowed, crumbling pages is written in the same crabbed, 
faltering handwriting. It's quite difficult to read, but you puzzle it 
out slowly. A Table of Contents says that the thin volume contains five 
separate letters. It is divided into sections by a beautiful coloured 
painting bound right into the book.
  You can look at section1, section2, section3, section4, or section5. ~
extradesc: section1
This page's facing page features a beautiful illumined picture of a man
facing a large group of demonic creatures. He holds up his glowing hands
and seems to have no fear at all in his face. The text reads:

  I have been traveling our realm for many years, and find myself
  falling to anger at the blatant slap in the face issued to the
  Order of Mielikki by Blackmourne's minions. Now, I know, being an
  old priest who has been fighting Evil for many years, that I should
  exercise discretion, that this will pass. But somehow, this latest
  assault on our charter feels different, and I have no confidence
  that the Gods of our land will protect us this time from the
  Archenemy.

  Morpheous, one of our patron gods, has been molding us for many
  years under the tutelage of the wise Kaaz clan. I suppose it is
  inevitable that our society, so deftly ruled and so wisely shepherded,
  would become a cause for jealousy. In my prayers, I have sensed the
  hatred and envy of the foul god Blackmourne. I pray he does not raise
  his hand against the world -- for if he does, who can stop a god?
  Not even the Kaaz clan could stand against all the evil a god may
  cause.

  Be ready for anything. The call to defend our gracious Goddess
  may come at any time, and we must not allow Blackmourne to prevail.

extradesc: section2
This section is faced with a picture of a decayed, disgusting human 
figure wearing a long, black silk robe. His face reveals no trace of 
normal human gentleness and kindness -- the cloak of his many years hangs 
very heavy on him. He's pure evil. The text on the next page reads:

  I have been traveling our realm for many years, my brothers and
  sisters in the faith, and I know that my learning is as yet not
  complete. However, bear with the words of one who is still learning:

  HOW can the Lord of Templace not demand the head of Ruin Wormheart
  on a golden plate? How can he not see the perfidy and cruelty of this
  supposed priest? Every day brings a new rumour and a new crime, and
  every day we see more of those vile Undead Knights coming into our
  beautiful cities. Wormheart is daring us to do something, my brothers.
  I pray none of us acts before the right time has come.

  Merely by reading the words of Ruin Wormheart's missives, one may
  get a feeling for the hatred of this person and those around him.
  He cloaks these evil, vile feelings in words of sweetness and light,
  but none of those who worship the Goddess can fail to see the truth.

  My warnings, brothers and sisters: Do not fall prey to this guild,
  and do not allow Ruin to provoke you... Yet. Our time will come, and
  we will wipe this degenerate guild from the face of the earth!

extradesc: section3
This section begins with a picture of the dwarven city, Anduin. The
city's walls are in ruins; warriors, both human and not, fight for
their very lives against a monstrous horde of demonic creatures. The
text of the message reads:

  Brethren,

  I have traveled this realm for many years now, and I hope that
  you all know me well enough to know that I would not waste your
  time without good reason or without just cause. 

  But this latest outrage demands our immediate attention! Those
  who can, journey to the twin cities at greatest haste. Those who
  cannot... Please favour your brethren with prayer and supplication.
  We will have to make our stand, and we will have to be victorious,
  or else our Guild will be wiped from the face of the earth.

  The demons that Blackmourne has called forth have already destroyed
  the city of the priests, and they have their eyes on the entire known
  world. We must act now, or we will lose the crowning city of the
  known realm to the foul creatures beyond the rift. Blackmourne has
  gained an ally in the equally evil god Angus, and together, their
  efforts in creating a rift between the demon plane, Gaar'laxxil, and
  our own has shaken the very foundations of our world. The demons know
  that should they win this war, they will feast on the fruits of our
  very world. What folly have we bred in endeavouring to create good!

                                In Yr. Service

extradesc: section4
This last section begins with a barely-colored painting of what must
be the City of Templace in its glory years. You recognize the Bronze
Golems and the huge gates immediately. In front of it are three human
figures, facing two huge humanoid figures. And above the two huge men
flies the biggest dragon you have ever seen... The text of the letter
reads:

  My brethren, I write to you with unfortunate news. I was in the
  city when the greatest atrocity of our age occurred, and it is with
  the heaviest of hearts that I pass these words on to you. Templace
  is destroyed, and it can never be rebuilt, and the devastation to
  the nearby area will never be undone!

  Angus and Blackmourne opened a rift in the very fabric of this plane, 
  bringing forth horrors from beyond it that no one's mind could 
  comprehend. But our fair Templace stood strong through all the 
  attacks. In desperation, they called forth the great black dragon
  Sagece from the Plane of Gaar'laxxil. As the beast stepped through
  the rift, her delicate foot-claws grazed the surface of the lake near
  Templace, and it turned black as coal in that moment.

  Our leaders, the great Kaaz clan, defied the assembled evils of the
  very gods, but the great dragon had help of the vilest sort -- from
  the direct hand of Blackmourne himself. Girr'Kaaz's power was such that
  without Blackmourne's aid, Sagece could never have defeated him. 
  Morpheous was deeply saddened by the destruction of his high priest, but
  imagine his horror when he went to claim the body, and saw that a wound  
  that could only have come from the blade of his own godly brother! He
  wept, my brethren. Morpheous disappeared from view with the sorry
  remains of our leader. I do not know what will happen now, but the
  skies seem to be holding their breaths. Pray, my brethren.

                                In Yr. Service
                                Elythaz, Cardinal of Templace-that-was ~
extradesc: section5
These pages of the book face a painting, beautifully rendered, of 
some sort of aerial explosion on a scale unimaginable to mortal eyes.
The text, written in a spidery script, reads:

  My brethren, there is again peace in our land, but at such a cost I
  hesitate to relay the story to you, for fear you will think I have
  taken leave of my senses.

  The All-Father himself, Metamorpho, appeared out of swirling mists
  when the city of Templace was destroyed. He was burning with the most
  holy wrath one can imagine, as terrible as an army with banners. He
  took up Morpheus, Blackmourne, and Angus, and all was quiet, save for
  the cries of the wounded. I tried my best to heal whom I could, but my
  strength was nearly gone. Like everybody on the field -- demon, human,
  and victim alike -- I carefully watched for the gods' return.

  When they did return, our gracious lord Morpheous, still holding the
  broken body of our Girr'Kaaz, performed a rite none have ever seen.
  Elia was furious that she could not perform the funeral rites, but
  she loves Morpheous as much as a human heart can love a god, so she
  allowed Morpheous to set his binding upon the world. The sky sparkled
  both with the power of the enchantment, and with the presence of many
  other gods, some of whom were newborn, some old and dear presences.
  They put their seal upon the ceremony. When it was over, Girr'Kaaz's 
  body turned to a kind of faerie-light that scattered all over the
  world. I write you only what I have seen, brethren.

  The gods did disappear just afterward, though I think Morpheous gazed
  upon the battlefield a short while. The Kaaz clan, what was left of it,
  scattered as well. I have not seen any of them since the battle.

  So that is where we are now, my brethren. Our mission is to rebuild
  this sorely shattered world and finish erasing the evils brought here
  by those whose greed nearly shattered everything we hold dear. If you
  happen to meet one of the Kaaz, do not alarm them, but report their
  movements to the Guild. I pray for their mental healing.

                          In Yr. Service,
                          Ausentharn, A Priest of the Northlands~

Quickly scanning through the text, you piece together a tale of good cause
corrupted and evil unleashed.  Once the letters begin dancing on the page, you
avert your gaze as to not completely lose your mind.~

extradesc: guard sleet-guard small-diamond-shaped-shield
Displaying an elaborate elven crest on its front, this sleet-white shield is
only as wide as a forearm is long, but used effectively could provide decent
protection.  The metal of the guard is fantastically thin, yet seems as strong
as, if not stronger than, well-tempered steel.~
extradesc: elven-crest
The elaborate elven crest is painted on the front of the sleet shield with
amazing detail.  It depicts a great lynx running on a blue background, with a
waving banner above it.  Some ancient elven runes are written across the
banner, but below the crest, the name Shiran appears in common script.    ~

This breastplate is somewhat small, likely designed for an elf or slender
human.  It is formed from a strange metal, ice-cold to the touch, yet not
melting in heat.  The plate is much thinner than steel, not even as thick as
most swords.  A series of leather straps on the back may be tied together to
hold the breastplate on.~

loving parents and more coalesce bringing with them a myriad of emotions and
feelings.  As quickly as they appear, they metamorphosize and vanish following
the logical illogic of dreams.  Entranced by the dream-like dance, you realize
these are the dreams of children, scooped from the Reverie and made visible.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

blade.  The blade of this dagger is hot to the touch and a dull red in color;
the handle of the dagger itself, however, is surprisingly cool.~

extradesc: crown gypsy-crown golden-crown-inlaid-emeralds emerald
This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~
