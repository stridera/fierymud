extradesc: kimono black-cotton jet-black-kimono
Made of thin black cotton, this kimono blends in perfectly with the shadows of
night.  Silk would provide a telltale sheen, though it would also be lighter,
but the black-dyed cotton absorbs light rather than reflecting it.  It is
utterly silent, not even giving the usual "whoosh" of fabric when moved.  The
sleeves fall only to the elbows, providing plenty of room to swing a weapon.  ~

This bracelet is made out of a very durable weaved grass that has several
spaced out snake fangs weaved into it.  The fangs are about an inch in length
and give the bracelet a menacing look.  The grass is a dull green color and it
is weaved tightly so it looks almost like it is one piece of grass.~

This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.~

is weaved tightly so it looks almost like it is one piece of grass.~
