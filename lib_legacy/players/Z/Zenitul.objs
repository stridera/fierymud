This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

extradesc: pendant ice crystal hexagonal hexagon ice-crystal-pendant
   A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.

About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in

creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.

extradesc: book enchiridion ench
The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time
itself -- that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater
than any the world has ever known, true love and blackest hatred,
friendship and betrayal.. all couched in the language of ancient
times to form a manual of behavior for magicians in the aftermath
of a war the likes of which may never be seen again... Though the
majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out or damaged,
enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.
~
extradesc: cover
The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.
~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.
~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.
~
extradesc: page3
This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small

   The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow. Gazing 
into its crystalline depths, there seems to be insubstantial forms 
floating within it. Before you can decide what lies within, you are 
forced to look away, lest its light blinds you.

It fastens with a steel clip.

How grotesque.  Some person's face - sex now indistinguishable - was stripped
to provide this awful covering.  No hairs remain on it anywhere, and it has
been tanned to prevent deterioration and to give it a supple, smooth feel.  
The eyelids are missing, and small strings are attached which go around the
wearer's ears.

This beautiful cloak is made of some kind of silky white fabric
sewn all over with the most amazing white feathers. Each full,
white feather has a single dark blue dot near its tip, giving
the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to
dappled. The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body, with
a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at
the waist.
