extradesc: jedi-cloak jedi cloak
The cloak is brown in color and is well used. It has a rough texture
and is made of a fairly heavy material. It appears to be a jedi's
cloak. It gives off a peaceful, relaxing feeling. A small tag on
the inside reads of the cloak reads...

              Property of Ben Kenobi, Jedi-Master.

It appears to be metallic in composition. There is a small button located
on one of the sides of the cylinder. Upon closer examination you notice
an engraving, which reads...

The plushie doll looks just like the great Overlord himself!  Althought cute
and cuddly, the plushie seems to have an air of authority about it.  It even
seems to question 'Done yet?  ' at its imaginary underlings...  Or perhaps
that's your imagination?

A plump, fresh, red strawberry has been dipped into chocolate, looking
absolutely tantalizing.  It smells slightly fruity and very sweet, inducing the
salivary glands to work their hardest.
