This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit! A tie-waist secures

way down to your feet. They look quite old, and seem to glow with some
kind of magical power. Perhaps they're enchanted!
