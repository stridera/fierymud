You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically
strong, for though it is very old, there are no dents, dings, or scratches
in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

The hood is purple leather, soft as silk, ornamented with golden

and back, allowing the hood to fall back. An attendant air of
disaster seems to hang around this hood, but you must admit, it
is very flattering.

of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,

      My beloved Arturio, please believe that I act only to protect
      you and Frederick. Remember the chants and spells I taught
      you and the rest of our family, and remember that yours is
      a rich heritage. Should you ever need the help of the Goddess

The letter has been folded and refolded many, many times.

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same

whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.

extradesc: pouch cloth
It's just a simple woolen pouch. The fabric is dyed a brilliant
red color, and there's some embroidery on its front. A cord closes
around the pouch's neck; the cord is quite long, long enough for
you to tie its ends around your belt.
~
extradesc: embroidery
The embroidery is of a strange kind. Usually embroidery is of
pretty things, for some sort of informative or decorative purpose,
but this picture is of a monstrous golden wolf-like beast with
eerily human eyes.

These bracers look as though they are regular metal which has been extracted
from a long and coolly burning fire.  They are scarcely more than bands of
metal any longer, but are solid despite the long, slow burn.

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the

exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.

of ice it is a fairly unremarkable dagger.
