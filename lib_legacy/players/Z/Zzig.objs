The orb slowly spins on a random axis, even when held.  Looking deep within its

extradesc: memento-lover's-soul memento-lovers-soul platinum locket
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    ~

It reads,
"My thought will be for you
My love will be in you
You are the one to love me
So I will live forever"~

This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you

unbearable to look at, but somehow seems to cast a cool glow across the area.~

Zzig, student of cryomancy:
 
To command the shards of ice in battle, we @0have finally
reached the stage where you must prove your mastery of
ice itself.  15 creatures of ice stand in your way, so
it will be necessary to defeat them.  As well, bring 17
items made of ice to show your craftsmanship skill.
 
It is of course not as simple as that, for ice takes many
forms.  Bring 4 items of snow as well, to command the ice
present in the deepest winter.  And what master of frozen
skills would be complete without mastering the storms that
bring ice and snow to the world?  I will need 4 storm items
and proof of the defeat of 5 storm creatures before you
will have proved yourself.
 
Finally, to show that you can master the formation of shards,
bring me three "shard"s that are not gems, and "shards" that
can be worn.
 
One last bit of trivia and we are done.  Using the knowledge
gained by studying sorcery, for you must be well suited to
research after all this time, bring me the answer to a single
question: Why is Black Lake black?
 
Once completed, you will be awarded with your most powerful
spell.  Good luck!

Zzig-

All your life has been spent studying water and cold
But now you @0desire a transformation more bold
To become one with water--a task most fulfilling
That will require much perseverance and drilling

First, absorb each of the realm's EIGHT spirits of WATER
Then you must slay the Moonless Night's adopted DAUGHTER
Soak her DAGGER with TWO shakes of SALT to quicken rust
And then thicken the brine with SEVENTEEN types of DUST

Collect the power of FIVE of the realm's most ANCIENT
With these in hand and because you have been so patient
Finally prepare the spell by obtaining a MOUND
Within which your soul and the waterform will be BOUND

To earn the right to wear the Purple Teardrop, one must prove their worth.@0

Aquire one item that proves you have HONOR. 
Then to the feet of Daroowise bring a sacrifice of 5 HEARTs.
Finally throw into the water of the Crane Fountain 6 FLOWERs.
Now to make the teardrop, I need the following.
Ten PURPLE dyes, One Golden Tear, and one DROP.
And in loving memory of Pergus, please trophy-spell ILOVEKILLINGRATS.
Then back up your claim with the heads of Twenty-two Monstrous Rats.
After you have completed these things, The Purple Teardrop shall be yours.

extradesc: bracers charred-bracers black-metal-bands
These bracers look as though they are regular metal which has been extracted
from a long and coolly burning fire.  They are scarcely more than bands of
metal any longer, but are solid despite the long, slow burn.    ~

These gauntlets have smoldered in the heat of a black flame for many ages, as
in apparent by the perpetual signs of soot lingering in all of the crevices.  
They are solid and well fashioned, yet appear to have degraded in the flames
over the years.~

This is a simple little ring, it is black with flecks of grey shimmering in and
out of being.  For the most part, the ring does not exist in any coporeal form,
but tends to wander back and forth to its ethereal state.    ~

You can't help but be entranced by this beautiful shell.  As large as your
