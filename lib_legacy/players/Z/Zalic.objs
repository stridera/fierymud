You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

extradesc: girth storm-giants-girth giant blue-steel-girth lightning
You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically
strong, for though it is very old, there are no dents, dings, or scratches
in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

This tambourine is made of two wooden discs pegged together. Through
the gaps in between them, someone has thrust pairs of small brass
circles. The slightest movement makes the circles jingle together,
producing a wild, mysterious cacophony.

extradesc: shield mothers-love mother love pink kindness glowing
This shield is made of bright blue-white steel, but it glows with
a faint pink aura. The design on the front is ancient and very
familiar, though you can't immediately place it for now. And if 
you put your ear against its softly thrumming surface, you can
hear what seems to be a lullaby, in a strong female voice touched
with gentleness.
