This ball of light is the most mysterious and magical things you have ever
seen.  The ball is very bright but yet dark at the same time.  The light shifts
from top to bottom and from side to side with small flares from time to time.
This is a miniature replication of the sun at midnight on some parts of the
earth.  Some great conjurer must have made this and given it to some great
person as a prize.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....
