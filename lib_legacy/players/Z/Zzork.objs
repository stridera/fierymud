When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed

wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over
time, the color was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light
brown. It's a simple two-piece conical sort of hood, coming to
a point well above the wearer's crown and falling back. A lively
tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.

extradesc: longsword gleaming
   The longsword has seen its time in battle, for the metal is nicked, dented
and has some minor spots of rust.  Although the metal is worn and abused, it
has been kept very well polished and gleams in the light.  You can see a dried,
black substance splattered on the grey cloth of the hilt, and the pommel is
scratched and broken.

Poorly constructed of rough wood with a thick layer of tightly stretched camel
hide over it, this shield nevertheless does its job, standing between its
wearer and attackers.  It appears to have seen quite the history of violence,
with numerous gashes and dents in the hide, but still holds together somehow.
