You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically

in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....
