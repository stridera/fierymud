This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

How disgusting! This bit of slick leathery fish bulges slightly, from
whatever its previous owner ate just before they parted ways. It smells
absolutely foul.

extradesc: cloak white feathers swan princess
This beautiful cloak is made of some kind of silky white fabric
sewn all over with the most amazing white feathers. Each full,
white feather has a single dark blue dot near its tip, giving
the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to
dappled. The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body, with
a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at
the waist.

extradesc: adornment light chain shimmering 
A small ball of light glows from an unknown source, but somehow still 
remains attached to a shining platinum chain.  It looks like a common 
necklace, except for the small glint of light that emits tiny beams that 
illuminate the palm of your hand.  Occasionally the light grows brighter for 
an instant, then fades back to normal.
