Warm to the touch and bright as the morning light, this small ring seems to
have no physical structure or support.  It appears to have been made of light
fused into a semi-solid and stable shape that adjusts naturally in size.~

This thin visor is cast from a mysterious white metal.  Apparently stronger
than steel, despite its thinness, it is almost impossible to deform.  A strap
hanging around the back allows the visor to be worn on the head to protect the
face.  Several vertical slits give the wearer a clear view of the surroundings.~

covered with small black studds, yet they make absolutely no sound.  They
play tricks with the light, fading in and out of sight occasionally, making
both them and their wearer difficult to detect.~

The leather boots have decorative patterns burnt upon the heels.  On the left

in a tree,with a large moon in the background.  The boots smell strongly, but
not in the normal way of leather, or boots.  A different, unidentifiable smell
emanates forth instead.  It's not entirely unpleasant.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

This belt appears to be made of small silver discs set with dark blue starstone
hemispheres.  However, upon closer inspection, you realize the glittering dots
within the hemispheres are not merely reflecting light - they are diminutive
pinpoints of luminescence contained in some kind of crystalline matrix.  They
swirl and float, giving a cosmic life to each disc.  Surely a treasure like
this must be a gift from the Gods!~

This 'scrap' of leather is actually a perfect rectangle and has nicely finished
edges and small, nearly invisible cords hanging from two sides.  In addition,
it seems to be reinforced with bands of padding, making it comfortable to wear.
It could easily be tied to the forearm, and would probably blend in well with
the darkness.~

extradesc: coracle small-bowl-shaped-watercraft boat
This small watercraft is oval-shaped, with a single small bench in the middle.
It is constructed of a round frame of branches over which the skins of buffalo
have been stretched.  It looks like it's limited to a single human-sized
occupant.  The bottom is stained much darker than the rest, apparently due to
the body of water in which it has spent much time: Black Lake.    ~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.~

The tube is stiff so its contents will not get folded or torn. The tube
has an opening at one end, perhaps you should glance inside?~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for

the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.~

The mandolin is fairly light for its size, made of a thin yet durable walnut
wood and skillfully stained in patterns of six-pointed flowers on the
teardrop-shaped sounding board.  The neck is also stained dark, and the tuning
pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.~

This small watercraft is oval-shaped, with a single small bench in the middle.
It is constructed of a round frame of branches over which the skins of buffalo
have been stretched.  It looks like it's limited to a single human-sized
occupant.  The bottom is stained much darker than the rest, apparently due to
the body of water in which it has spent much time: Black Lake.    ~

things close up, or so the legends go.~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.~

The tube is stiff so its contents will not get folded or torn. The tube
has an opening at one end, perhaps you should glance inside?~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

The tube is stiff so its contents will not get folded or torn. The tube
has an opening at one end, perhaps you should glance inside?~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn

this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

It is hard to discern the edges of this tunic, for they fade and shift from
sight, as if actively avoiding detection.  While apparently made from
black, studded leather, the tunic is lighter than most cloth and can be violently
shaken without making a sound.  Tunics of this kind are often presented to
high-ranking rogue guild members and are not given away lightly.~

extradesc: boots-assassin black-studded-leather-boots
These boots are made from hardened leather, dyed black and covered with steel
studs.  Eerily not a creak or a whisper comes from these boots, which makes them
perfect for sneaking while armored.  In addition, they are very light, which
keeps them from impeding movement.  A pair of boots like this would be a
perfect gift for anyone who valued stealth and quickness.~

It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~
