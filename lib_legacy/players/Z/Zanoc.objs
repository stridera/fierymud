You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

extradesc: pouch cloth
It's just a simple woolen pouch. The fabric is dyed a brilliant
red color, and there's some embroidery on its front. A cord closes
around the pouch's neck; the cord is quite long, long enough for
you to tie its ends around your belt.
~
extradesc: embroidery
The embroidery is of a strange kind. Usually embroidery is of
pretty things, for some sort of informative or decorative purpose,
but this picture is of a monstrous golden wolf-like beast with
eerily human eyes.
