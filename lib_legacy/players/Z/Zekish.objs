way down to your feet. They look quite old, and seem to glow with some
kind of magical power. Perhaps they're enchanted!

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

As you look at the large white dragon's egg, you seem to remember something you
heard long ago.  Something about how a dragon's egg had special powers.  Now
what was that.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

These gloves seem very thick and would probably protect the wearer from heat.
Most useful for a smith or armourer.  They seem to give off small puffs of
white powder when they are beaten though?

Hmm, the white powder seems to be asbestos.  Lovely.  Course with your
lifestyle I wouldn't think that would be the cause of your demise >;-)

extradesc: green-staff-growing thin-hollow-staff wisdom
The thin staff is as light as a hollowed out tube, but as strong as any metal
sword picked off the forge.  The green glow radiating from the brown oak gives
the impression that the stick is naturally green.  The glow seems to emanate a
deep wisdom.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

Crafted from a solid shard of hardened night, the ring refuses to let even
light caress it.  The band is thin yet does not seem weak by far.  A small
place at the top feels very thick and round.  At a straight look it is almost
like one could see movement from inside.
