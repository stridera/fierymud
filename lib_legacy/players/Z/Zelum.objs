You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time
itself -- that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater
than any the world has ever known, true love and blackest hatred,
friendship and betrayal.. all couched in the language of ancient
times to form a manual of behavior for magicians in the aftermath
of a war the likes of which may never be seen again... Though the
majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out or damaged,
enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.

Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.

This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small
caption near the bottom of the page reads "NAU I S". That is all you
can tell for sure.

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically
strong, for though it is very old, there are no dents, dings, or scratches
in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.
