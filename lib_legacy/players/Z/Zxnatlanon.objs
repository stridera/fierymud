extradesc: coral ring coral-ring
The coral ring seems totally flawless. It is made of the finest coral
you have ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white
on the other. It is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance
so that it is not the least bit abrasive.~

it obvious that you hold it there. Those swirling folds of
black and white satin would easily confound an opponent,
