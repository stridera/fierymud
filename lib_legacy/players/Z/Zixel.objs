This action figure appears to be an exact replica of Dakhod!  With a peg leg
and a hook for a hand, the attention to detail is stunning.  This action figure
comes complete with karate chop action when its legs are squeezed, and a
pullstring on his back.

wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over
time, the color was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light
brown. It's a simple two-piece conical sort of hood, coming to
a point well above the wearer's crown and falling back. A lively
tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.

extradesc: foot lucky-rabbits-foot lucky-rabbit-foot
Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.

This backpack is able to contain a large selection of goods, but its bulky
size makes it quite heavy. It is crafted from a fine waterproof leather,
and seems capable of resisting most adverse weather conditions.

Tooth-like serrations give this blade a wicked edge. The sawing action
of the teeth catches extra bits of flesh as it slashes. A tapered end
forms a natural grip.

It's a very heavy club made of granite or some other grey stone.  It would
