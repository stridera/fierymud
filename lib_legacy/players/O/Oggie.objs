extradesc: necklace bat tooth
When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed
hastily with clumsy hands. The teeth vary in shape and size making you
wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

The rock neckguard appears to be chipped and sculpted from a single large
stone.  Previously constructed for the huge Bozaks, it is almost too large for
your neck.  The neckguard is sturdy enough to withstand almost any attack.

The yellow of this flower is so deep and shiny that it's reflected off any
surface brought near.  The stem is still green and unwilted, so it can't have
been picked long ago.
