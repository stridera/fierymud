fused into a semi-solid and stable shape that adjusts naturally in size.~

It is hard to discern the edges of this tunic, for they fade and shift from
sight, as if actively avoiding detection.  While apparently made from
black, studded leather, the tunic is lighter than most cloth and can be violently
shaken without making a sound.  Tunics of this kind are often presented to
high-ranking rogue guild members and are not given away lightly.~

These boots are made from hardened leather, dyed black and covered with steel

perfect for sneaking while armored.  In addition, they are very light, which
keeps them from impeding movement.  A pair of boots like this would be a

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully

elliptical pupil in the middle.  This tattoo gives the bearer the look of an
archetypical beast, combining intricately detailed scales, elaborate feathers,
and ridged horns along the temples.  Bold colors, reds, blues, greens, golds,
burst out of the design to emphasize power and strength.  The ink is infused
with the blood of the greatest beasts from all across Ethilien.  Infused with
such power, the tattoo causes the bearer's eyes to burn with a fierce inner
light, piercing the dark with fiery determination.~

There is a small inscription on the pommel.~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.~

handle is silver with a worn, white leather grip and the head of the goremaul

the grip is a holy symbol.~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.~

Though starstone itself is not inherently magical, a weapon like this almost

handle is silver with a worn, white leather grip and the head of the goremaul
is inlaid with orichalcum, a rare alloy of gold that is said to be especially
effective against evil creatures.  The weapon hums slightly with a not
unpleasant buzz, constantly reminding someone that it is there.  At the base of
the grip is a holy symbol.~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.~

still extremely potent.  Weapons such as these are carried by Fangs of
Yeenoghu, warrior-shamans imbued directly with a demonic spirit by Yeenoghu
himself.  This one has three spike-headed orbs dangling from long chains,
attached to a sturdy haft.  A bulging eye is drawn on each orb in blood, an

nothing spectacular.~

This large weapon is a two-handed sword with a very long blade made of steel
with very little in the way of sharp edges, since it's meant for brute hacking.
The hilt is made of bronze, with bronze crossguards and little ornamentation
or decoration.  The pommel is weighted perfectly with a smooth white alabaster
stone, opaque and milky-white.  There is no sign of what the stone signifies.~

There is a small inscription on the pommel.~

Though not exactly industrial-sized, these garden shears have a wickedly- sharp
serrated edge to their blades and a handle that feels warm and heavy in your
palm.  Certainly they could clip through the most stubborn of dragon- shaped
shrubbery and perhaps even be turned to more gruesome ends - wouldn't those
blades do a number on someone's arm or fingers, and wouldn't it be something to
see the metal handles protruding from the back of yon adventurer?  Indeed, the
shears make for a nasty weapon.
 
There is an inscription of some sort along the handle.~

is entrancing.  The flames around the ring leap and swirl, dancing in an almost

Mounted on a sturdy leather bracelet, a small leather sleeve hides a
silver-hued dagger that can be flipped out with a skilled flick of the wrist.
The bracelet is secured on the wrist by several thin leather straps.  The
dagger is a little longer than a human hand, reaching just far enough from the
wrist to do some serious damage.~

A reward for completing a single, perfect act, this weapon is as deadly as it
is entrancing.  The flames around the ring leap and swirl, dancing in an almost
hypnotic pattern.  Though the ring gives off light and heat, it isn't hot
enough to burn your hand when you touch it.  The flames wrap around your fist,
joining you with the ring in one perfect flame.~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.~

The javelin is made of brass and at first glance appears to be an inferior
weapon. However, a close inspection of the weapon reveals that the metal
has been enchanted or somehow enhanced, for the balance and strength of
the javelin is superior to any other you have seen.~

An ancient form of weapon similar to a maul, the goremaul is set with tiny
barbs at the head to cause ripping damage along with the usual bludgeon.  Its
handle is silver with a worn, white leather grip and the head of the goremaul
is inlaid with orichalcum, a rare alloy of gold that is said to be especially
effective against evil creatures.  The weapon hums slightly with a not
unpleasant buzz, constantly reminding someone that it is there.  At the base of
the grip is a holy symbol.~

An involuntary grin crosses your features as you judge the superior heft 
and balance of this mining tool. Its head is made of battered steel; its 
long handle is of some hardwood you've never seen before, wound with 
leather thongs. Though it is clearly intended to be a mere workman's 
tool, its high quality makes you wonder how well it would function as a 
weapon.~

This farm implement seems somehow more sinister than other sickles. Its
shaft is made of wood, with two sections wrapped in thongs. The blade is
quite long and similar in shape to a scimitar. It protrudes out from the
shaft quite some distance, then rounds back towards it in a vicious curve.
Overall, it seems like quite a clumsy weapon, but wielded properly, it

This large weapon is a two-handed sword with a very long blade made of steel
with very little in the way of sharp edges, since it's meant for brute hacking.
The hilt is made of bronze, with bronze crossguards and little ornamentation
or decoration.  The pommel is weighted perfectly with a smooth white alabaster
stone, opaque and milky-white.  There is no sign of what the stone signifies.~

You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far from
here.  It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much lighter, lucky
for you!  The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's slightly clenched
clawed forefoot.  But it's fallen on hard times--its handle is broken, and its
surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft and balance.  It's still quite
usable, though no experienced warrior would be interested in wielding it, since
its power is greatly reduced because of its condition.  But a junior trainee
would be thrilled to have this once-impressive weapon.~

You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far from
here.  It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much lighter, lucky
for you!  The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's slightly clenched
clawed forefoot.  But it's fallen on hard times--its handle is broken, and its
surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft and balance.  It's still quite
usable, though no experienced warrior would be interested in wielding it, since
its power is greatly reduced because of its condition.  But a junior trainee

is entrancing.  The flames around the ring leap and swirl, dancing in an almost

enough to burn your hand when you touch it.  The flames wrap around your fist,

extradesc: goremaul gore-maul celestial-goremaul silver-maul-inlaid-gold
An ancient form of weapon similar to a maul, the goremaul is set with tiny
barbs at the head to cause ripping damage along with the usual bludgeon.  Its
handle is silver with a worn, white leather grip and the head of the goremaul
is inlaid with orichalcum, a rare alloy of gold that is said to be especially
effective against evil creatures.  The weapon hums slightly with a not
unpleasant buzz, constantly reminding someone that it is there.  At the base of
the grip is a holy symbol.~

The bracelet is secured on the wrist by several thin leather straps.  The
dagger is a little longer than a human hand, reaching just far enough from the
wrist to do some serious damage.~

This staff was made from the limb of a Silveroak tree. Perhaps the Druid
who originally owned this powerful staff received it as a gift from the
tree, for it is inconceivable that anyone would harm a Silveroak by
cutting off a limb. The staff retains the tree's bark and shimmers brightly

You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far from
here.  It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much lighter, lucky
for you!  The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's slightly clenched
clawed forefoot.  But it's fallen on hard times--its handle is broken, and its
surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft and balance.  It's still quite
usable, though no experienced warrior would be interested in wielding it, since
its power is greatly reduced because of its condition.  But a junior trainee
would be thrilled to have this once-impressive weapon.~

still extremely potent.  Weapons such as these are carried by Fangs of
Yeenoghu, warrior-shamans imbued directly with a demonic spirit by Yeenoghu
himself.  This one has three spike-headed orbs dangling from long chains,
attached to a sturdy haft.  A bulging eye is drawn on each orb in blood, an
invocation of Yeenoghu to watch the butchery committed in his name.~

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.~

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.~

You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far from
here.  It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much lighter, lucky
for you!  The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's slightly clenched
clawed forefoot.  But it's fallen on hard times--its handle is broken, and its
surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft and balance.  It's still quite
usable, though no experienced warrior would be interested in wielding it, since
its power is greatly reduced because of its condition.  But a junior trainee
would be thrilled to have this once-impressive weapon.~

This long weapon is somewhere between a lance and an axe.  It has a single
straight blade with a sharpened edge, much like an axe, but with a long curving
tip like a lance.  Attached to a simple metal haft, the weapon is heavy and
brutal.~

Darker than any night sky, this blade appears to be crafted from a solid piece
of darkness.  Not a gleam nor sparkle, the blade seems to swallow light rather
than repeal it.~

extradesc: dagger emerald-hilted-dagger steel-bladed-dagger faceted-emerald-hilt
This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.~

You realize what this is, it is the horn of the mythical unicorn. Amazing!~

Created from only the purest of dark magick, the blade is light and seemingly

in serenity and chaos.~
