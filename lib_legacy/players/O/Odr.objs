Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.    ~

This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light
is so bright as to hurt the eyes, yet it is only a bit warm to the touch.  
Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead

extradesc: meat pie pastry
Golden, buttery pastry crust forms a double-handful of some
kind of handheld pie. You smell meat inside it, a little cool
from its earlier baking, but still delicious.~

This kind of trumpet is traditionally used for heraldry to announce the coming
of knights or kings.  While well cared for, it bears clear signs of regular
use.  If it could speak, what stories of nobility and honor would it tell?~

Upon closer inspection, you realize this isn't gold at all, just pyrite, also
known as "fool's gold" or "kobold gold.  " Even though it's not work much,
pyrite still makes lovely jewelry.  This tiny nugget is mounted to a small
post, making it a large statement piece for a kobold or a a tiny spec for an
ogre or barbarian.~
