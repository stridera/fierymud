Light seems to flow naturally from this ancient golden medallion.  Symbols of

of the sun dominating its center.

extradesc: droppings nasty bit bird
     Yech!  Though the birds within the aviary's walls are far from
domesticated - much less housebroken - happening upon such a nasty bit of
droppings is an unpleasant surprise; generally the aviary grounds crew seem to
do a pretty good job keeping the paths clean, turning such offal into the soil
to act as fertilizer for the exotic plant life.
     The core of the droppings is a greenish-grey snakelike solid, surrounded
by an off-white liquid that is quickly drying in the sun.  Though bird
droppings do not have the disgusting smell of other animal feces, they are
still rather repulsive nonetheless.

extradesc: mask-deception smooth-black-mask
The mask is smooth to the touch, yet no highlights are visible on its surface.
Its color is that of the deepest black.  Expressionless ovals allow its wearer
to see, and small openings assist with breathing, but no other feature is
visible.  Indeed, it appears to float in front of its wearer's face with no
means of support.

The bouquet is made up of what must be a hundred absolutely perfect
roses. Most of them are cream colored, but there are a few golden 
ones thrown in to add artistic flavor. The bouquet is very large,
going down to the bride's knees, but it's so light that she could
carry it easily.

You've never seen such a magnificent gown! It's good enough for a 
princess or queen to wear to her nuptials, with a long, flowing skirt
of white silk tulle, and a bodice of the same and covered in handmade 
laces from around the world. The leg-o-mutton sleeves end in triangles
of soft white fabric that partially cover the backs of the bride's hands. 
Truly, it's a magnificent garment.

Lace is so finely crocheted from white silk thread that it seems
like this veil is made of spiderwebs. It covers the head, but 
does not obscure the features in any way, instead ghosting an
image of its wearer.
