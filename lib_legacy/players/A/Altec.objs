When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.~

Where many tools dedicated to demonic forces are heavily detailed with runes
and symbols indicating their dark purpose and their masters, this blade has
none of those traditional trappings.  A blade made of blackened steel, sharp
yet unrefined, produced for one purpose only: to shed blood in the name of
Demon Lords.  On it is a single eye, the symbol of Yeenoghu, the Beast of
Butchery, so he may watch every kill up close.~

The sword feels light in your hands as you inspect it.  There are many
scratches and dents in it, but it remains razor sharp to the touch.  The
gleaming metal that it has been forged from is superior to most other materials
used for swords.  The handle is layered in gold and silver, with very detailed
designs of ivy leaves.  There is an inscription on the handle.~
