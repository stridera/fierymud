extradesc: ring wedding-ring silver-leaves-ring ari-torowa-ring
Beautiful and delicate, this priceless ring has a base of some soft green metal
which is overlaid with an incredibly realistic display of silver leaves.  Each
leaf is different, representing oack, ash, birch, yew, and other trees sacred
to those who hold Nature dear to their hearts.  Intertwining around the leaves
is a delicate vine, representing the unity of those bound by the rings.  
Heartbreaking in its purity, it is nevertheless very sturdy and could probably
withstand the harshest of conditions.    ~

Smoky quartz is a powerful mystic matrix because it energizes like clear quartz
but also has strong connections to the realms of sleep and dreams.  Set in
silver, a ring like this provides powerful connections to both the moon and the
Reverie, making it highly prized by faeries and witches alike.~

However, it could easily be wrapped around the wrist, creating a beautiful and

nature to produce beauty and perfection from the darkest of places.  Such an
ever-growing blossom as this is created only for very powerful druids.~

A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a
grip, indicating that it could be used as a weapon.  Whether or not it would be
a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~
