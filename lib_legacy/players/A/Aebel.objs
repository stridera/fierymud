It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

The book almost hums with power. You approach it reverently, ready to see
the face of some god in its pages, but then... Then... You feel its sheer
evil resonating. This is no ordinary book. And it is nothing holy.~

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically

in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

It's just a simple woolen pouch. The fabric is dyed a brilliant

The embroidery is of a strange kind. Usually embroidery is of
pretty things, for some sort of informative or decorative purpose,
but this picture is of a monstrous golden wolf-like beast with

This is the primary flight feather of the giant cavern hawks near the
Stormchild's keep.  Dark gold in color, it is nearly three feet long.  If
someone were large enough, they could probably use it as a quill pen, but other
than that it would make a nice trophy.

To Petch:

To begin, we will need to do some research, so hit the librari@0es and
retrieve 5 TOMEs.  Make sure you leave no LIBRARY or LIBRARIAN witnesses.
 
Next, collect the components of the spell: 2 CHERRYs, some PINEAPPLE
juice, and the soul of a PHANTASMIC creature.  To assist in the magick,
we will also need two items that cast 'cure blind' and four that cast
'sense life'. 
 
Finally, reap the lifeforce of three evil WIZARDs and five WRAITHs and
we shall have finally have gathered the strength to cast the vision of
distance-transcendence.
 
Good luck!
