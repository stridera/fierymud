mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.

extradesc: loaf bread rye
     Baked apparently from grains harvested within the aviary itself, this loaf
of bread is coarse and rather crude, but certainly looks appetizing to the
empty of stomach.  Breaking the dark brown loaf open, there are quite a few
whole kernels and seeds of grain still intact, and the flour certainly was
barely crushed and sifted.  Perhaps this bread was intended as more of a treat
for the birds above than for human consumption.

This beautiful little jewel is shaped oddly, and appears to be very valuable to someone at least.

extradesc: shears garden pair nasty
     Though not exactly industrial-sized, these garden shears have a wickedly-
sharp serrated edge to their blades and a handle that feels warm and heavy in
your palm.  Certainly they could clip through the most stubborn of dragon-
shaped shrubbery and perhaps even be turned to more gruesome ends - wouldn't
those blades do a number on someone's arm or fingers, and wouldn't it be
something to see the metal handles protruding from the back of yon adventurer?
Indeed, the shears make for a nasty weapon.
     There is an inscription of some sort along the handle.

extradesc: feather breeches pair
     These fine pants are made of a light fabric to which are sewn hundreds of
soft feathers.  The plumage looks to have come from all sorts of birds, with
long blue and green feathers likely from parrots lined up beside the smaller
browns, whites,  and greys of birds like finches and budgerigars.  Though their
value as armor might be questionable, the breeches do look to be rather warm
and even comfortable - and a must-have for every dandy's wardrobe!
