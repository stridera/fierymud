extradesc: iron rations
These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!

      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)
