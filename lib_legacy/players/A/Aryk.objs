Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food
make this area a haven for all sorts of creatures of the forest.

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.

of bread is coarse and rather crude, but certainly looks appetizing to the
empty of stomach.  Breaking the dark brown loaf open, there are quite a few
whole kernels and seeds of grain still intact, and the flour certainly was
barely crushed and sifted.  Perhaps this bread was intended as more of a treat
for the birds above than for human consumption.

the most foolhardy would not look to its own defense.  It looks as if someone
has drilled two holes in the sides of the beak and run a leather thong through
them so that you could tie the hookbill onto your head; it might also function
well as a kind of dagger in hand.

The book is leatherbound, and masterfully made, with thick paper pages. 
Written there, in flowing, well-trained script, you read:

   Day 22, Month of the Winter Wolf
   My men go out today to battle the Frost Elves across the mountains. I do 
   not know how to prepare my troops. Yesterday, Lady Rill sent her Amazons 
   to assist me in Queen Serazais' mad quest, but I do not know if even 
   they will make much difference in this fight. We are outnumbered. That 
   obscene little man Serazais sent me, that outlander necromancer, last 
   night cast a spell he said would protect us, but I don't believe it'll 
   work. Ah!-- I hear the war-trumpets. Pray to whatever gods you pray to 
   that at least some of us will return alive, my dearest Thraja.

This is the last entry in the book. You see no further entries in the 
beautifully crafted journal.

Nothing smells quite like the slightly burned sugar in a well-baked sugar
cookie.  This one is bright yellow with a slight orange tinge where the sugar
started to burn.  It smells delicious.

extradesc: cane wooden
It is a wooden cane, just long enough to hold onto its bulbous
end and use to aid in walking. It's slightly dinged up from
time and the elements, but it maintains its usefulness.

   The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is
both too bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.

extradesc: bonewhip bone whip
The handle of this whip is dark wood, while the lowest part of its tail is
reinforced with several vertebra.  They appear to come from a medium-sized
animal, perhaps the size of a deer.  The remainder is braided, bleached
leather, except for three small fingerbones attached to the end.
