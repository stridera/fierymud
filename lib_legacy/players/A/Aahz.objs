These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!

      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)~

This lantern glows a pale green light that makes you chill all over.  It is a
permanent light source, originating from the world of the undead.  How it got
here, no one knows.~

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.~

This odd little draconic scale is burning with some sort of internal fire,
making it quite warm but bearable to the touch.  It seems to impart some of its
fieryness into its holder, promising power and strength to its wearer.~
