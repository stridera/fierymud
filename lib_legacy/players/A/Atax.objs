Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for

The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time itself --
that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater than any the world has
ever known, true love and blackest hatred, friendship and betrayal..  All
couched in the language of ancient times to form a manual of behavior for
magicians in the aftermath of a war the likes of which may never be seen
again...  Though the majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out
or damaged, enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.~
extradesc: cover
The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.~
extradesc: page3
This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small
caption near the bottom of the page reads "NAU I S". That is all you
can tell for sure.~

reach from atop the handle to bash an enemy that is to close for the spike.  
The spike is quite a large ball of protruding lengthy and wide needles, close
to a spear tip.  All black, at night one may not even see the weapon coming.~

This doll is more beautiful than one can imagine.  It depicts a woman, her hair
a shiny black, as dark as night.  The cloth for her skin is pale and she is
dressed in a dusty white robe.  She has odd little wooden talons fixed to the
end of her hands, looking as sharp as any sword.~

Title: The Lost Library of Shiran
Author: Karlix the Omniscient

"...and a great civilization rose and prospered.  They achieved such
wealth and status and they did not want the knowledge they had gathered
and strove for to be lost to succeeding generations.  So they built a great
library on an island off the coast of their great city.  Into this library
they placed all the knowledge they had gathered over the centuries.  Great
tomes about life, mythical creatures, far away and mythical lands, great
items of magic, etc, etc.  Such was the knowledge that they possessed that
it is rumored the gods got jealous and deemed the information kept in that
library too great for mortal minds.  And so, it is rumored it was the
gods who destroyed the Library and with it all the knowledge kept
therein..."~

Somewhat short, even for a doll, this little cloth replica is made to appear
totally engrossed in her tiny book.  She looks scholarly, with thin wire
"glasses" set upon her head.  A half-smirk sits on her lips and a strange
yellow symbol sits on her forehead.~

The doll has pliable arms and legs, not quite limp, but their position is
easily changed.  Although a relaxed look is stitched onto his face, he seems to
have an inexplicable alertness.  Some long scars are stitched on his back,
resembling lash marks.  An unfamiliar symbol on the doll's forehead glows
bright red.~

It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~

The mandolin is fairly light for its size, made of a thin yet durable walnut
wood and skillfully stained in patterns of six-pointed flowers on the
teardrop-shaped sounding board.  The neck is also stained dark, and the tuning
pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.~

extradesc: broadsword broad-sword alabaster-pommelled-broadsword alabaster-pommel
This large weapon is a two-handed sword with a very long blade made of steel
with very little in the way of sharp edges, since it's meant for brute hacking.
The hilt is made of bronze, with bronze crossguards and little ornamentation
or decoration.  The pommel is weighted perfectly with a smooth white alabaster
stone, opaque and milky-white.  There is no sign of what the stone signifies.~

The flute appears to have been whittled by a professional whittler.  It's the
perfect replica of a flute, and even sounds good when you make a terrible
attempt at playing it.  There's a name carved toward the bottom of the flute.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~
