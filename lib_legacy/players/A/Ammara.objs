This warm, large garment is tailored entirely from feathers.  Upon closer

attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.~
