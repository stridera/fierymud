This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

of a visit from a band of powerful sorcerers who were impressed with Neris'
kindness and presented her with a holy scarab that has some power to it.  The
leader of the sorcerers is shown speaking aloud to Neris refering to her as
"Neris'Kaan", or "Neris the Kind".

Looking closer at the dark form, you realize that it is some form of amulet.
As if aware of your interest, it flares with a dark light briefly, revealing
the following: Lin'trau vendil martook umse. You feel something within you
mend and a power from beyond merging with your own.

extradesc: book
   The cover of the book is formed from a solid chunk of bark, with the spine
made somewhat flexible by soaking it in some liquid and gently bending it into
shape.  Each page seems to have once been a leaf from a local tree, torn into a
roughly rectangular shape.  The writing is done in some kind of charcoal or ash
- because of this, the contrast makes some of the words hard to decipher.  On
the whole, the book is in fairly good shape, and is still readable.    

The headings in the book are PAGE1 PAGE2 . . .  PAGE8
~
extradesc: page1
Well, I must do something to keep myself from going mad.  I figure I shall 
write my thoughts, as I have an eternity to postulate about things. Why,  
you may ask, do I have an eternity?  Settle in, the story is quite long.

Years ago, I was king of a prosperous kingdom in a land you've probably 
never heard of.  We farmed our land quite efficiently, and there were no
major problems in the kingdom for years at a time.  Then,  I had a son,
Errious, brought to me by my lovely wife.  He was a strong young lad, and 
quite fit to take over the throne after I passed on.  

He loved to travel, and over time mapped out parts of the land outside our 
borders, where noone in our family had likely set foot on for generations.  
In the process, he met a lovely elven woman by the name of Norina. He made 
sure to stop by her home as often as he could in his journies, often for 
just a day at a time, while relaxing after exploring. 

The text continues on PAGE2
~
extradesc: PAGE2
Now, around the time that Errious was to return, I fell ill, and was bedridden
for several weeks with a delierious fever. In the meantime, my wife took over
rule of the kingdom, which was the norm when I was unavailable.  When my fever
finally broke, I was disheartened to find out that my son had not yet returned. 

My wife had sent one of our finest horsemen to the area where we knew he had 
headed. Several days later, we found his head, and a note.  It seems that our 
neighbors didn't like our latest visits.  In the meantime, my wife had rallied 
our knights, and had sent them to attack our newfound enemies. 

In hindsight, it was a hasty decision.  It was a fairly even match, but because
of that, the war raged on.  With our proximity, they managed to destroy our
crops, and we in turn, immolated theirs.  Both sides were suffering greatly,
and no real progress was being made in either's favor. 

The story continues on PAGE3
~
extradesc: PAGE3
Finally, after several weeks of battle, both sides spirit had been broken, and
we sent a courier to ask for a diplomatic meeting between their leader, Izaro,
and myself.  By this point, his kingdom too was greatly suffering, and he
agreed.  We agreed to meet.    
 
In the meeting we discussed the war- after saying somethings that shouldn't be
said, it turned out that Errious had been seeing Norina, who was Izaro's
daughter.  Alas, Norina was married to a prince from a nearby kingdom, who was
helping his father put down a peasant revolt during the 'visits'.    

One day, he had returned to find Norina and Errious.  He claimed that Errious
had killed Norina, and he defended himself.  I know that cannot be true- I
raised him better than that.  More likely they were both killed in a fit of
jealousy.  In either case Norina and Errious both died that day, and both our
people demanded blood.    

The drama unfolds on PAGE4
~
extradesc: PAGE4
We sent our men away, and agreed secretly to a dual to end it all.  Both our 
sides had lost too much, and the fighting needed to end now.  We chose to meet 
far away from the kingdom, and take turns leading farther into the forest, far 
away from any help one's kingdom could give.  It was to be a truely one on one 
battle. 

We eventually reached an area of dense forest with a clearing, and mutually 
decided it would be the setting of the battle.  I could tell by his ways that 
he was a spellcaster, and he could tell by my sword that I wasn't.  As the 
battle begun, I immediately rushed him, and kept him dazed enough to keep him 
from casting. 

And so the battle went.  He was a quick man, and kept from taking too many 
blows, but I was wearing him down.  But then, he managed to sprint out of my 
range, and got off one spell.  I never believed in my life that one spell could 
end my life, but as he finished his incantation, I looked up and saw a large 
ball of light, heading for me.

The end is on PAGE5
~
extradesc: PAGE5
The large ball of light turned out to be a burning rock, and it was quite 
enormous. Before I could react, it crushed me.  One spell, and I was dead.  I 
suppose my soul wanted vengeance.  I couldn't just die, and thus I'm here now.
Somehow, he managed to capture me in this. . . room.  For some reason I can't 
escape. 

So I sit, and think, and write.  I know not what happened to Izaro- he could 
not have made it very far, as wounded as he was.  The forest was still full of 
dangerous beasts, and the smell of blood was sure to attract more. But I 
cannot help but feel he wasn't destroyed, otherwise why would my soul be 
trapped here?

Someday, I will destroy him, and in doing so, hopefully be free to finally 
venture into the afterlife.  Until then, I write. Someday, someone may find 
this, and I hope it will teach them something.  War is stupid. If only I would 
have realized the consequences so long ago, maybe things would not be as they 
are.

This page consists of a number of sketches of what seems to be the same thing 
from different angles.  It appears to be a suit of armor with some sort of 
wings attached to the back of it. The wings are connected with some elaborate 
pulley system to the arms, giving the look of a bird which tangled itself up
in a net.

The caption reads 'Para-assault System'.

In my time here, I have learned much about nature.  I've learned to make
fire from basically nothing.  I've learned to use the remnants of that fire to
write this book.  I've learned that with the right point of view, nature is a
powerful entity.  

As such, I write the following such that you might glimpse just a touch of 
the powers of nature that I have learned in my many years here. May nature be 
there for you whenever you need her.  

King Thelmor 

Beneath the signature is a series of runes that are rather indecipherable, 
especially in their current condition.  It would be amazing if whatever he 
imbued this book with still worked.

   The bronze staff in your hands is huge-- it's almost too large to hold 
effectively. It pulses with power, its gemstone decorations lit as if 
from some inner radiance. A crystal on its tip sparkles with light. Your 
hands tingle at contact with it. You wonder what it does.
