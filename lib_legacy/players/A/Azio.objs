A shiny disc of polished steel makes the main part of this piece of armor.  
Tooled across its edges with a scrolling design, everything about it, from the
subtle decorations to the fine straps, makes it look expensive and highly
effective.  There are only a few little dents in its surface to mar its
mirror-like perfection.~

This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light
is so bright as to hurt the eyes, yet it is only a bit warm to the touch.  
Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead
of glass.    ~

Beaten steel makes up the main part of this door-shaped shield.  Large enough
