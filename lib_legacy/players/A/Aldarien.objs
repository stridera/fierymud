   The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow. Gazing 
into its crystalline depths, there seems to be insubstantial forms 
floating within it. Before you can decide what lies within, you are 
forced to look away, lest its light blinds you.

extradesc: golden ring sapphire sapphires hawk hawk-ring
A slender golden band with delicate whorls of knotwork is the setting for a
rather remarkable gem.  Though it is a small sapphire, no bigger than a wheat
kernel, it is shaped into the form of a hawk descending onto ints prey, talons
outsretched.  It was surely crafted by magic, for what gemcrafter, no matter
how skilled, could perfectly replicate something that small and detailed?

Black cloth forms the skin of this demon-like doll, with bolts of blue
lightning painted across its surface.  Puffs of cotton are attached, resembling
a storm floating about its body.

This doll is more beautiful than one can imagine.  It depicts a woman, her hair
a shiny black, as dark as night.  The cloth for her skin is pale and she is
dressed in a dusty white robe.  She has odd little wooden talons fixed to the
end of her hands, looking as sharp as any sword.

This little avian doll is covered in actual rich, deep red feathers from a
rosella.  Its beauty could easily be mistaken for a blossoming flower, albeit a
flower with a large wooden hookbill.  Little wooden feet stick out of the
bottom, but don't seem to serve very well for balance, as the doll has trouble
standing up.

its white skin is discolored, giving it a sickly appearance.  Its red bead eyes

other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.

your friends if you eat too much of it, as it can cause very bad breath.  It

Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.

Garlic is said to be able to ward off vampires.  It certainly will ward off
your friends if you eat too much of it, as it can cause very bad breath.  It
is, however, excellent at curing minor illnesses such as the common cold.

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.

These wings look so real! A metallic golden frame supports two
somewhat large wings made of some kind of silk that stretches to
the point of being almost transparent. Some kind of sparkly things
are woven into the silk, making the wings shimmer as they move.
