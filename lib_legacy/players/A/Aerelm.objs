Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.~

These fine pants are made of a light fabric to which are sewn hundreds of soft
feathers.  The plumage looks to have come from all sorts of birds, with long
blue and green feathers likely from parrots lined up beside the smaller browns,
whites, and greys of birds like finches and budgerigars.  Though their value as
armor might be questionable, the breeches do look to be rather warm and even
comfortable - and a must-have for every dandy's wardrobe!~
