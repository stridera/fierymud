Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

extradesc: boots chaotic-boots wicked-looking-evil-knight's-boots knights
These boots are an anomaly, for they have been polished smooth and clean, but
they absorb all light and reflections, making them boots of palpable darkness.
The occasional warp or buckle appears randomly on the surface, almost like the
boots are straining to conform to their shape.~

The obsidian of the vambraces is run through with dark red swirls and streaks,
like unholy blood coursing through the veins of a demon's hide.  The sight of a
warrior clad all in armor of this nature would be awe-inspiring and horrific at
the same time.~

Faint black flame surrounds these greaves, though they leave no burns when
touched.  Combine that with the sharp, jagged points along the edges, these
greaves appear to have come straight from some underworld realm.  Probably made
of enchanted onyx or obsidian, these greaves are excellent armor for a dark
warrior.~

This chestplate bares the image of a huge demonic face, pounded out in
bas-relief across the entire surface.  Forged from steel as burned as black as
night, then molded and dedicated to a particular evil entity, the wearer is
granted great unholy power, protecting them as they rain evil and chaos down on
the realms.~

This is a quite heavy broad-bladed sword.  The handle is wrapped in a bit of
old rug, with softened leather wrapping around it holding it down.  The nob
looks like an upside down crown, capping the end and holding the tapestry
securely.~

These leggings are made of a magically hardened ice called ice-steel.  
Ice-steel is as hard as steel and weights as much as ice.  On the thigh of each
leg is an image embossed in a strange red ice.  The image is the symbol of the
cult of Tri-Aszp: a bleeding dragon's claw~
