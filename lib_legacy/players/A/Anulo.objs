The flame seems simultaneously large and small, hot and cold.  Oddly, it feels
substantial in your hand, like a soft shapeless mass.  Its soft glow throws a
green hue over the area.

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

Thick and woolen, this quilted garment seems like it would keep

still servicable. To your modern eyes, the embroidery on it seems
distinctly unwarriorish, but in its day, it must have been an
extraordinary garment.

Not much more than a sliver from a much larger dragonscale, the surface of this

marred by jagged claw-like marks though, as if the shard were torn from the
whole scale by force.  A tiny pin on the back of the shard makes it easy to
clip onto a cloak or tunic.  A small dragon claw is etched into the clip.

extradesc: claw etching clip
The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky
finger, but its detail is exquisite, with every scale on the claw painfully
chiseled into the metal.  The claw has a burning blue color, its glow somehow
drawing you in...

Cast from the finest dwarven silver, this locket is beautifully carved and
decorated by wonderfully complex patterns and runes.  A tiny clasp on one side
locks the hinge on one side of the locket, enclosing the memories of those who
have passed on and become forgotten.  An aura of mourning and remoteness
surrounds the locket, flowing from the tiny portrait painted within-the face is
neither male nor female, neither old nor young.  Expressionless, the face
nevertheless seems to be lonely, crying for remembrance.

Not much more than a sliver from a much larger dragonscale, the surface of this
shard still has the lustery glitter of its original wearer.  The edges are
marred by jagged claw-like marks though, as if the shard were torn from the
whole scale by force.  A tiny pin on the back of the shard makes it easy to
clip onto a cloak or tunic.  A small dragon claw is etched into the clip.
~
extradesc: claw etching clip
The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky
finger, but its detail is exquisite, with every scale on the claw painfully
chiseled into the metal.  The claw has a burning blue color, its glow somehow
drawing you in...

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.

It's a simple rectangular piece of expensive greenish sea-silk.  The shawl
offers no real protection from the elements or from physical attacks, but it
seems to be blessed by the sea's spirit.

Not much more than a sliver from a much larger dragonscale, the surface of this
shard still has the lustery glitter of its original wearer.  The edges are
marred by jagged claw-like marks though, as if the shard were torn from the
whole scale by force.  A tiny pin on the back of the shard makes it easy to
clip onto a cloak or tunic.  A small dragon claw is etched into the clip.

The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky
finger, but its detail is exquisite, with every scale on the claw painfully
chiseled into the metal.  The claw has a burning blue color, its glow somehow
