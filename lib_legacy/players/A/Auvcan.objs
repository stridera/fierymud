extradesc: ring wedding-ring-silver-ice-golden-fire gold shining beautiful auvcan-voltel-ring-unique
This ring is small, yet anything but simple.  At first, it seems like a simple
ring of intertwining gold and silver strands lit with an inner fire, but it
feels alive, and indeed upon closer inspection it is revealed that the golden
bands have the glitter of living flame, flowing like molten flame around the
silver bands.  They also glimmer, but with the power of coldest ice.  One would
expect these two opposing elements bound together would destroy each other, but
instead the flame burns brighter and the ice rests cooler because of the
opposition inherent in them.  The binding is tighter than ever, a joyous
inclusion of difference.    ~

This plain metal band made of either silver or electrum holds a small dark blue
starstone gem.  Hundreds of thousands of tiny mineral deposits within it
reflect and refract light like stars twinkling in the dark, giving it its name.
Though starstone itself is not inherently magical, a ring like this almost
certainly is!~

and another of lustrous pale blue-green moonstones.  The reflective qualities
of the semi precious gemstones interlaced with the natural sheen of the fabric

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!

      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill

extradesc: tome aqua-mundi gold-trimmed-leather-bound-tome spells book
This softly glowing book contains some of the most miraculous and dangerous
magic known to Cryomancers.  Embossed with gold and written with golden ink,
the magic radiating from the tome is palpable.  Flipping through it, the book
has many long-lost spells like To Bring Winter on Water, Fisher of the Polar
Deep, Blood Bender, Phantom's Gondola, the Burning Rain of Death, Watergate,
and more.~
