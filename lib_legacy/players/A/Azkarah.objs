They are finely tailored of regular coarse linen and dyed black.  With their
close-fitting form, they certainly cut a nice figure beneath a robe.~

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~
