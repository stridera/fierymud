These cups fit exactly around their wearer's shoulder, protecting
it from the all-too-frequent blows that break through a fighter's
defenses. They're plain, with only an embossing around their edges
as decoration. Leather straps hold the spaulders tight against the
shoulders and down part of the arm, criss-crossing at the chest
and back.
