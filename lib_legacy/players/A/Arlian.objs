It appears to be metallic in composition. There is a small button located
on one of the sides of the cylinder. Upon closer examination you notice
an engraving, which reads...

              Property of Ben Kenobi, Jedi-Master.

extradesc: rose formed sapphires sapphire sapphire-rose
A stem of silver with tiny thorns supports a gorgeous bud of sapphire, looking
as though it has barely begun to bloom.  It has a slight scent similar to that
of fresh rain wafting from the sapphire head, making it very pleasant to smell.
Inscribed on the stem are tiny holy symbols.

   The chestplate is pure silver in color, radiating in the light and
reflecting it back with a bit more intensity.  The metal has been polished and
kept very clean, even though there are minor imperfections such as sword marks
and small dents.  There are markings along the sides, etched into the metal.  
The markings bear the letters SH and are surrounded by runes of some sort.

These work boots are made of dark brown leather. They go about calf-high,
and though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled
along its edges. They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable
for anybody wanting some basic protection.

Hi Arlian,
Am in the middle of my quest for Meteorstorm and have a couple of
items that I need that are !rent.  Hence idling out.

Unfortunately real life and work don't let me play much.  This is
complicated by the fact that I'm in Australia, so my play time
is most of you northern peoples work time :).

Enjoy.

Marlia
