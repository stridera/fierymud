Though it looks like metal, this ring is actually made out of the lustrous
stone hematite.  It is slightly more brittle than a metal ring and very cool to
the touch.  It looks like it would fit a slender finger better than a thick one
- it would be a shame to have such a nice ring shatter.~

anyone wearing it.  The dragon symbol is set in the center of the back, showing
a pale dragon done in metallic thread shimmering in the light, standing rampant
with a five-taloned foot raised as if in greeting.  The dragon looks, as
dragons tend to, extremely fierce.  Inside the collar in gray thread is the
maker's mark stitched into the fabric, but it is faint enough that it cannot be

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  The spheres glow with a faint blue ghost
light.  Upon closer inspection it seems these orbs are eyes of some kind.  
Being certain is difficult as they are blurry and indistinct, fully ethereal
and translucent, so details are hard to make out.  Yet you can feel something
piercing through you, like the spheres are looking right through your very
soul.~

The worn out leather book binding is almost falling apart.  It is very old

the pages were written on different days as if a journal would be.  You can
read a few of the first pages: page1, page2 and page3.~

For all that are powerful
Bringing fists down on the weak
Smashing their souls
And breaking the meek

May they soon meet their maker
Brought forth for their misdeed
Wrought down into the ground
Stomped flat their greed

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence 
Then let us to ascend~
extradesc: page1
   The quaint sounds of spring fill my ears with a joy not found else where.  
The breeze showers my skin with the sensations of the air.  This feeling
empowers me with the creativity that is unrivaled by others.  Like floating on
top of the world without the weight of gravity to pull me down.    ~

............THOUGHTS............
   Thoughts drain like water
  Down into the consciousness 
   Collected in a small form
Then spread out to be recollected 
  Rearranged and transformed 
Until they collide with perfection 
     Forming what would be
          What could be
 The greatest thought of them all~

The coral ring seems totally flawless.  It is made of the finest coral you have

is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance so that it is not the
least bit abrasive.~

This is a pair of fine goggles, made of expertly tanned leather and lenses of
thick glass.  Excellent for protecting the eyes from the loose dust and
occasional hazards in a mine, they would probably also be useful outdoors in a
sandstorm, though underwater use would probably ruin the leather and is not
recommended.~

This is the feather of a large vulture.  The feather itself is quite ugly and
dull.  It is a plain brown color and the feather is ruffled everywhere making
it look messy.~

The scroll appears to be the surveyor's notes of the lay of the land.
There is a PICTURE and a LEGEND here for your perusal.~

The legend, printed in a bit of blank area on the map, reads:

The map is very blurry and hard to make out, as if water has been
spilled on it very often, or sprayed across it.

The whisk is only as large as a woman's hand, and made of bamboo.  Several
pieces of light bamboo have been woven together at the handle, their ends
allowed to fray to form a whisk.  It's lightweight, and its whorled strands of
bamboo would make it an excellent whisk for the powdered tea of the tea
ceremony of Odaishyozen.~

Pog's notes on the Brushland Region:
Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food
make this area a haven for all sorts of creatures of the forest.

My soul is happy to see this.~

  &3&b***POINTS OF INTEREST***&0
   |&1&b1&0: There are far too many interesting things that go on in the theatre to 
   |   list them all here.  The players also tend to roam around theatre so
   |   pinning them to one spot is impossible.  So start here, talk to the
   |   Leading Player, and enjoy the magic (and madness) of... The Theatre!

     About as big around as your fist, the smooth off-white surface of this egg
is speckled with tiny flecks of blue and yellow, giving it an almost marbled
appearance.  The egg is warm in your hand, and you can almost feel the beating
of a tiny heart inside it.  Perhaps if kept properly warm and cared for, in a
few days the most wonderful of treasures might be discovered inside.~

This cloak was once quite fancy and shaped perfectly.  Now, however, it is torn
and somewhat discolored.  The silvery lining is shredded and has lost its glint
and sparkle.  The owner of such a cloak must have been quite wealthy, and it is
a wonder why such a precious item would go to waste.  It has a lone, long faded
symbol across the back.~

The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.

&0This neatly rolled parchment looks quite new, perhaps two weeks old at
the most.  Its crisp white paper is nicely kept, as is the swirling blue
text that has been scrawled along its surface:

Do not worry, Lord Gundbard.  The key is safe with me.  I apologize for
abandoning my post, but rumors were abound of trouble near Fangron
Forest.  My oath bound me to protect the innocent, so I must leave
immediately to offer my aid.  I should be back within a week's time.

Sir Gloris Whiteblade,
Holy Templar~

The egg is an oval about the size of a human child's fist with a matte white
surface speckled with pale red splotches.  The shell is soft and leathery, more
like a lizard or snake egg than a bird egg, and is quite warm to the touch.  
How it has survived such an environment is anyone's guess!~

this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

   The small scrap of leather has been worn beyond belief.  Its edges are
frayed and it is very soft to the touch.  There is a very small portion of a
picture that is crafted onto it, lending to the certainty that it is from a
larger piece of artwork.  Judging from the condition of the leather, this has
been around a long time, and held regularly as someone's good luck trinket.  ~

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

clean, even though there are minor imperfections such as sword marks and small
dents.  There are markings along the sides, etched into the metal.  The
markings bear the letters SH and are surrounded by runes of some sort.~

Sections of fur and hide stitched together in thick layers provide extra

many pelts billow in voluminous waves, giving the illusion of ever-growing size

attachment point, a sign of respect to the raging spirits of the wild such a
garment evokes.~

The mask shimmers slightly as you hold it up and you see yourself reflected.  
There seems to be a subtle difference between what you see and how you remember
yourself to appear to others.  Perhaps this is the real you.~

Some of the pages seem to be marked, in particular page16 and page37
which talk about future directions for more powerful spellcasters and
how to encode a simple cipher respectively.

The preface briefly states how essential it is for a spellcaster to
protect his spells against accidental or deliberate theft, by encoding
them.~
extradesc: page16
A passage has been circled on this page, it reads:
    ...so in order to ensure that the magic user has a copious supply of
willing subjects for his experiments, he must first ingratiate himself with
his chosen town by generous acts. An intelligent mage will try and get
himself accepted into the council, and perhaps even move for a law which can
be used to aid him. This could state that all mad people be locked up, or
all criminals be killed. We all know how easy it is to turn a mind to madness
and the mage may then take these subjects 'under his protection' and
experiment on them without worry, as the populace soon forget what has
happened to them...

There is also a note in the margin which seems to be a calculation of some
sort and a reference to page23.~
extradesc: page23
Ack, its a recipe for unlimited power, but it involves several unsavoury
ingredients including human organs. A passage has been circled on this page
too, and it reads:
    ...obviously in order to get this many human hearts is impossible
which is why this spell still remains theoretical, although if one were
to perfect some sort of cloning technique, coupled with a spell for creation
of a human, then it might be possible to create a human with many vestigial
organs which would presumably still be valid for the recipe...

Your skin crawls as you continue to read, anyone who really thought this
sort of stuff would work would have to be mad right?~
extradesc: page37
There are some simple ciphers on the page here, and some notes in the margin
which look like the would have continued onto page 38, only that page has
been torn out of the book! You read the notes anyway and puzzle over the
missing data:
    ...and as has been known through history the simplest cipher is a
substitution whereby one letter is substituted for another (for example
the next letter in the alphabet) and the message is rewritten. The decoder
knows that the letters are shifted by a certain number of positions and
can easily decode the message. This is known as a monoalphabetic cipher. A
more complex 'polyalphabetic' cipher such as the Vigenere cipher may also
be used. The illustration on the next page shows this in action, but basically
the implementation is as follows:
     1) the keyword is chosen and repeatedly written below the phrase to be encoded
     2) the combination of keyword letter and phrase letter are used to index  the Vigenere tableau
     3) the indexed letters form the encoded phrase
And the decryption works in reverse, going down the column indexed by the
keyword letter to the encoded letter, and determining which letter heads that
row. Obviously a keyword of all 'a' would not encrypt at all.
The page ends here!~

Unfortunately, this page has been ripped from the book.~

The mask is not built from a solid material, but formed from a thick, dark

and even felt, giving it the illusion of being solid.  The smoke that swirls
around it is vividly dark and gloomy, creating a supernatural look.  There are
no apparent straps used to leash it to your face.  It seems that the smoke is
wrapping around your hands as if to hold on, so it might do the same for your
face.~
