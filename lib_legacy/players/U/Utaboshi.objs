This armor is so light that you wonder that it could be at all effective!  
Made from strips of bamboo cleverly lashed together with wire, it covers from
the throat to the knees.  It looks like it ties in the back.~

extradesc: tasseled-hood crumpled fabric
The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over time, the color
was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light brown.  It's a simple two-piece
conical sort of hood, coming to a point well above the wearer's crown and
falling back.  A lively tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.~

Red and brown seaweeds have been woven together to form a skirt of sorts.  It
is very sturdy and would hang down past your knees although you have doubts as
to how well it would protect your modesty.~
