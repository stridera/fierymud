The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  It seems to light up the
area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.~

bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.    ~

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

Oregano is a rather mild herb used to add zest to otherwise plain dishes.  It
is said to help in restoration spells and help someone with chronic weakness
gain strength.  It goes well in tomato sauces with basil and garlic.    ~

your feet.  They look quite old, and seem to glow with some kind of magical
power.  Perhaps they're enchanted!~

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

The flower resembles a perfect looking daisy, and is yellow in color.
The flower smells good enough to eat, and just looking at it makes you
kind of hungry. The more you study the flower, the more it looks like
some type of magical food, rather than a real flower. ~

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.    ~

A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.~
