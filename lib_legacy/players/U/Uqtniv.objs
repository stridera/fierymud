These work boots are made of dark brown leather.  They go about calf-high, and
though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled along its
edges.  They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable for anybody
wanting some basic protection.~

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

The spetum is a vastly improved spear.  It has a long narrow blade with two
projections below the thrusting blade which are used to catch an opponent's
weapons and disarm her.  However, the spetum is much heavier than a normal
spear.~

These work boots are made of dark brown leather.  They go about calf-high, and

edges.  They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable for anybody
wanting some basic protection.~
