  The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand. It seems to light up
the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

The gloves each feature 3 long blades originating from the top of the hand.  
When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

   This is the legendary Stormshield, once used by the Lords of this keep.
Resembling a large heater shield, there is a heraldic design emblazoned
upon it. It is said that this shield was forged by the Gods themselves in
the beginning of the world.

extradesc: helmet carefully-crafted-wooden-helmet beautiful
Crafted from the finest wood, this helmet is both sturdy and comfortable.  It
sits softer on the head than a metal helm, and provides extra insulation
against the elements.  Intricate green artwork decorates its outer surface,
depicting leaves and trees.

extradesc: mask-deception smooth-black-mask
The mask is smooth to the touch, yet no highlights are visible on its surface.
Its color is that of the deepest black.  Expressionless ovals allow its wearer
to see, and small openings assist with breathing, but no other feature is
visible.  Indeed, it appears to float in front of its wearer's face with no
means of support.
