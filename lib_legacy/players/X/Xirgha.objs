It looks as though it's a simple ring carved from ice, although upon closer
inspection you notice that the small ring is made of tiny carved square
ceremonial masks.

The hood is purple leather, soft as silk, ornamented with golden
ribbon around the edges. Its lappets hang down the wearer's chest
and back, allowing the hood to fall back. An attendant air of
disaster seems to hang around this hood, but you must admit, it
is very flattering.

extradesc: tights purple purple-tights snug-fitting pair rolled ball discarded
These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit! A tie-waist secures
them at the waist, and the thick woolen material goes from there all the
way down to your feet. They look quite old, and seem to glow with some
kind of magical power. Perhaps they're enchanted!

The box is made of extremely hard wood that has been weathered.  It looks much
like a case which might be carried, except is now fixed into the wall,
hopelessly stuck in the grip of the ice.  Inspecting the case closely reveals a
small lock in the side of it.  There is a strange shimmer coming from the
inside which definately comes from something else being present, but it would
take a dragon's eye to see for certain while the case is closed.
