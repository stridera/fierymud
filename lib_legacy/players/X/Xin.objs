This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

extradesc: nasty jagged fiery greaves chaotic
Faint black flame surrounds these greaves, though they leave no burns when
touched.  Combine that with the sharp, jagged points along the edges, these
greaves appear to have come straight from some underworld realm.  Probably made
of enchanted onyx or obsidian, these greaves are excellent armor for a dark
warrior.

extradesc: jet black jet-black helm horns chaotic
This helm is forged from some Stygian-black metal that does not burn but
leeches the life out of the world around it.  From the side of the helm winds
two large horns, gleaming with a sinister life of their own.  Black flames burn
about the horns, showing their truly Infernal nature.

The javelin is made of brass and at first glance appears to be an inferior
weapon. However, a close inspection of the weapon reveals that the metal
has been enchanted or somehow enhanced, for the balance and strength of
the javelin is superior to any other you have seen.
