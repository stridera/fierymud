This long robe is crafted from a deep blood red crimson. It comes with a
matching sash, used to tighten it about the waist. Not very effective in
combat, but better then nothing.

They are finely tailored of regular coarse linen and dyed black.
With their close-fitting form, they certainly cut a nice figure
beneath a robe.

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.
