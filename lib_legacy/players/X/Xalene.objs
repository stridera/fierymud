It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes are
strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads.  Here and there little
strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form interesting
geometric designs.  This necklace is a charm from the Wizardess Thekra; you

This dagger is made of a magically hardened ice that is called ice-steel
because it takes on the strength of steel.  Besides being composed entirely of
ice it is a fairly unremarkable dagger.~

These gauntlets are covered in the blood of many sacrifices, each one dedicated
to the diabolist for whom these gauntlets were forged.  Scorched in Infernal
fires and tempered with unholy magic, the gauntlets lend the wearer aide in
ritual and, of course, slaughter.~

This grand pair of customized drow boots appears to have just been completed
after many hours and days of labor.  The flawless leather straps glisten with
every bit of light that crosses its surface.  The extra cushioning and soft
padding along the sole ensure that these boots are not only comfortable, but
very protective.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~

You behold a cloak made of some kind of thin, blood-red damasked silk
embroidered over with dark blue silk thread in cunning designs.  The collar is
lined in thick, deep brown fur.  You get the uncanny feeling that this flowing
cloak isn't quite what it seems.  It seems to have a sense of power to it.  
Some sense of intuition you didn't even know you had tells you to handle this
cloak carefully.~
