Warm to the touch and bright as the morning light, this small ring seems to
have no physical structure or support.  It appears to have been made of light
fused into a semi-solid and stable shape that adjusts naturally in size.~

This shiny silver ring is slender enough for a woman to wear, but not
excessively feminine in shape.  It is set all around with amethyst cabuchons,
unfaceted and round-faced, set into silver edgings that are raised slightly to
show off the purple jewels.~

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes are
strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads.  Here and there little
strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form interesting
geometric designs.  This necklace is a charm from the Wizardess Thekra; you

Hugely stylized celestial runes have been engraved into this gorgeous
chestguard.  Each rune relates to the domains of the original owner's deity,
putting the priest into further contact with their gods' power.  Made of the
purest mythril, this plate holds the strongest holy enchantments, designed not
to make the wearer the warforce of the gods, but to be their voice and spirit
among mortal man.~

can withstand quite a bit of damage.  They are padded on the inside with white
fur, preventing the frigid white metal from touching skin.  The plate metal is
slightly curved and much thinner than average steel, undoubtedly created by
some uncomprehensible elven miracle.~

You behold the legendary Stormcloak, once worn by the mighty Stormlord, Holder

giving the impression of thousands of tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into
its brocade surface.  It's quite heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held
together by a bronze clasp, beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon
whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you
look at it, touch it.~

supreme power.  A single inscription is written around the base of the mace
head, where it attaches to the haft.~

The inscription reads: "I am the phoenix who guides the souls to the
Netherworld when they go forth.  " It is clear this mace serves one purpose and
one purpose only: to send the souls of the unquiet dead back to their eternal
rest.~

These vambraces are forged from mythril, a metal that when in its purest form,
can hold great spiritual power and divine favor.  Each set of vambraces like
these is made for a specific cleric in the name of a specific deity, both of
which are indicated in intricate designs across the surface of the plates.~

relatively unadorned.  Strong spiritual enchantments have been placed on these
gauntlets however; the healing aura around them is unmistakable.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~
