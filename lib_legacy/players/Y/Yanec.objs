extradesc: foot lucky-rabbits-foot lucky-rabbit-foot
Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.

Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
