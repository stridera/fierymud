&0A simply designed torch, consiting of a burning rag and long slender
wooden pole. Looks like it could last for eight hours or so.

extradesc: christmas-wreath large-green-wreath
Constructed from a large bough of an evergreen tree, twisted back upon
itself into a large circle, this wreath smells with the wonderous winter
scent of Christmas.  Various pine cones and berries are tied into the
wreath, and a large red bow on one side adds a vibrant splash of color
to the decoration.  The hole in the center is fairly wide, probably
large enough to fit over your head...

They are finely tailored of regular coarse linen and dyed black.
With their close-fitting form, they certainly cut a nice figure
beneath a robe.

This plain wooden staff is imbued with a peaceful feeling, making
it useless in combat. But it does help one walk rather nicely.

      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)
