extradesc: locket-forgotten tiny-silver-locket chain-knot
Cast from the finest dwarven silver, this locket is beautifully carved and
decorated by wonderfully complex patterns and runes.  A tiny clasp on one side
locks the hinge on one side of the locket, enclosing the memories of those who
have passed on and become forgotten.  An aura of mourning and remoteness
surrounds the locket, flowing from the tiny portrait painted within-the face is
neither male nor female, neither old nor young.  Expressionless, the face
nevertheless seems to be lonely, crying for remembrance.

You behold a cloak made of some kind of thin, blood-red damasked silk 
embroidered over with dark blue silk thread in cunning designs. The 
collar is lined in thick, deep brown fur. You get the uncanny feeling 
that this flowing cloak isn't quite what it seems. It seems to have a 
sense of power to it. Some sense of intuition you didn't even know you 
had tells you to handle this cloak carefully.

This ring is very beautiful.  The diamond is a rare blue color, accented by the
platinum it is set in.  Faint outlines of a swirling cloud motif add texture to
the ring, though barely enough to notice.  It looks like it was made for a
lady's hand...  A very wealthy lady's hand.

This shiny silver ring is slender enough for a woman to wear,
but not excessively feminine in shape. It is set all around with
amethyst cabuchons, unfaceted and round-faced, set into silver
edgings that are raised slightly to show off the purple jewels.

A slender golden band with delicate whorls of knotwork is the setting for a
rather remarkable gem.  Though it is a small sapphire, no bigger than a wheat
kernel, it is shaped into the form of a hawk descending onto ints prey, talons
outsretched.  It was surely crafted by magic, for what gemcrafter, no matter
how skilled, could perfectly replicate something that small and detailed?

   The main body of this exquisite ring is made of bright silver
that seems to glow aquamarine-blue with an inner light. The pearl
that adorns it is stunning and larger than usual, with deep blue
sapphires running otter-swift around the main center of attention.
The ring is neither wide nor narrow, making it wearable by either
men or women.

Here is the description for the TCD sleeping room
The sleeping quarters ap@0pear to be barracks and is a large, magnificent room used for temporary 
occupancy.  Their main object of the barracks is to separate clan members from the civilian population 
and reinforce discipline, training and esprit de corps. It is sometimes called the discipline factory. 
Built on a site originally intended for a mansion of the Pergus, the room has several large squares, each open on the south side. 
The largest square, Gung's Square, has arcaded colonnades on the east and west sides, and the other sides are faced with granite.  
The squares are linked with glass faced structures which gives no privacy to the occupants.
There is a large gallery near the entrance with a main focus on arts, craft and wares, including exhibits on: 
Dargentan's coins, silverware from Sunken Castle, furniture salvaged from Templace, folklife and costumes gathered throughout the realm, ceramics, glassware, etc. 
Included are artifacts such as Elven vases, gauntlets worn by Metamorpho when he was slain by Morpheo, 
a life belt and oar salvaged from the wreck of the ship Ehlissa and a pocket book carried by Elron whilst imprisoned in the Barracks.   
Ventilation is poor in the prison room, a sewer has been ventilated into it and there is much damp
