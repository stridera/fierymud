patchy bark of the branch is left natural, the crevices between the patches
exposing the golden wood beneath.  One end comes to a naturally terminating
point; the other is wrapped in light leather and bolted into place.  The wand
is otherwise unadorned.  A small tag is attached to the wand.~

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's

hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!
     (Hint : you need something to write on...then
      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)~
