You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

Not much more than a sliver from a much larger dragonscale, the surface of this
shard still has the lustery glitter of its original wearer.  The edges are
marred by jagged claw-like marks though, as if the shard were torn from the
whole scale by force.  A tiny pin on the back of the shard makes it easy to
clip onto a cloak or tunic.  A small dragon claw is etched into the clip.

The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky

extradesc: jet black jet-black helm horns chaotic
This helm is forged from some Stygian-black metal that does not burn but
leeches the life out of the world around it.  From the side of the helm winds
two large horns, gleaming with a sinister life of their own.  Black flames burn
about the horns, showing their truly Infernal nature.

You can see that this girth must be not only magical, but intrinsically
strong, for though it is very old, there are no dents, dings, or scratches
in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

Date: Jun 10 2009
  To: Flike
From: Laoris

Hi Flike,

You submitted an idea last weekend asserting that dispel magic@0
should deal damage to insubstantials.  What you may not know
is that dispel magic already does damage to creatures of the
magic life force.  Unfortunately, most of the insubstantial
creatures in the game are of the undead life force (while some
of them may be animated by magic, we can only set one life
force per creature, so they can't be both undead and magic).

Take a glance at the life force help entry for a list of the
life forces in the game.  If you find an insubstantial mob
whom you believe would make more sense as magic rather than
as one of the other life forces, let me know or submit another
idea for that creature in particular.

Thanks!

-Lao

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

The book is leatherbound. It's quite old, obviously. When you open it,
a cloud of fine dust flies up, tickling your nose and stinging your eyes. 
Each of the yellowed, crumbling pages is written in the same crabbed, 
faltering handwriting. It's quite difficult to read, but you puzzle it 
out slowly. A Table of Contents says that the thin volume contains five 
separate letters. It is divided into sections by a beautiful coloured 
painting bound right into the book.

extradesc: section1
This page's facing page features a beautiful illumined picture of a man
facing a large group of demonic creatures. He holds up his glowing hands
and seems to have no fear at all in his face. The text reads:

  I have been traveling our realm for many years, and find myself
  falling to anger at the blatant slap in the face issued to the
  Order of Mielikki by Blackmourne's minions. Now, I know, being an
  old priest who has been fighting Evil for many years, that I should
  exercise discretion, that this will pass. But somehow, this latest
  assault on our charter feels different, and I have no confidence
  that the Gods of our land will protect us this time from the
  Archenemy.

  Morpheous, one of our patron gods, has been molding us for many
  years under the tutelage of the wise Kaaz clan. I suppose it is
  inevitable that our society, so deftly ruled and so wisely shepherded,
  would become a cause for jealousy. In my prayers, I have sensed the
  hatred and envy of the foul god Blackmourne. I pray he does not raise
  his hand against the world -- for if he does, who can stop a god?
  Not even the Kaaz clan could stand against all the evil a god may
  cause.

  Be ready for anything. The call to defend our gracious Goddess
  may come at any time, and we must not allow Blackmourne to prevail.

extradesc: section2
This section is faced with a picture of a decayed, disgusting human 
figure wearing a long, black silk robe. His face reveals no trace of 
normal human gentleness and kindness -- the cloak of his many years hangs 
very heavy on him. He's pure evil. The text on the next page reads:

  I have been traveling our realm for many years, my brothers and
  sisters in the faith, and I know that my learning is as yet not
  complete. However, bear with the words of one who is still learning:

  HOW can the Lord of Templace not demand the head of Ruin Wormheart
  on a golden plate? How can he not see the perfidy and cruelty of this
  supposed priest? Every day brings a new rumour and a new crime, and
  every day we see more of those vile Undead Knights coming into our
  beautiful cities. Wormheart is daring us to do something, my brothers.
  I pray none of us acts before the right time has come.

  Merely by reading the words of Ruin Wormheart's missives, one may
  get a feeling for the hatred of this person and those around him.
  He cloaks these evil, vile feelings in words of sweetness and light,
  but none of those who worship the Goddess can fail to see the truth.

  My warnings, brothers and sisters: Do not fall prey to this guild,
  and do not allow Ruin to provoke you... Yet. Our time will come, and
  we will wipe this degenerate guild from the face of the earth!

extradesc: section3
This section begins with a picture of the dwarven city, Anduin. The
city's walls are in ruins; warriors, both human and not, fight for
their very lives against a monstrous horde of demonic creatures. The
text of the message reads:

  Brethren,

  I have traveled this realm for many years now, and I hope that
  you all know me well enough to know that I would not waste your
  time without good reason or without just cause. 

  But this latest outrage demands our immediate attention! Those
  who can, journey to the twin cities at greatest haste. Those who
  cannot... Please favour your brethren with prayer and supplication.
  We will have to make our stand, and we will have to be victorious,
  or else our Guild will be wiped from the face of the earth.

  The demons that Blackmourne has called forth have already destroyed
  the city of the priests, and they have their eyes on the entire known
  world. We must act now, or we will lose the crowning city of the
  known realm to the foul creatures beyond the rift. Blackmourne has
  gained an ally in the equally evil god Angus, and together, their
  efforts in creating a rift between the demon plane, Gaar'laxxil, and
  our own has shaken the very foundations of our world. The demons know
  that should they win this war, they will feast on the fruits of our
  very world. What folly have we bred in endeavouring to create good!

extradesc: section4
This last section begins with a barely-colored painting of what must
be the City of Templace in its glory years. You recognize the Bronze
Golems and the huge gates immediately. In front of it are three human
figures, facing two huge humanoid figures. And above the two huge men
flies the biggest dragon you have ever seen... The text of the letter
reads:

  My brethren, I write to you with unfortunate news. I was in the
  city when the greatest atrocity of our age occurred, and it is with
  the heaviest of hearts that I pass these words on to you. Templace
  is destroyed, and it can never be rebuilt, and the devastation to
  the nearby area will never be undone!

  Angus and Blackmourne opened a rift in the very fabric of this plane, 
  bringing forth horrors from beyond it that no one's mind could 
  comprehend. But our fair Templace stood strong through all the 
  attacks. In desperation, they called forth the great black dragon
  Sagece from the Plane of Gaar'laxxil. As the beast stepped through
  the rift, her delicate foot-claws grazed the surface of the lake near
  Templace, and it turned black as coal in that moment.

  Our leaders, the great Kaaz clan, defied the assembled evils of the
  very gods, but the great dragon had help of the vilest sort -- from
  the direct hand of Blackmourne himself. Girr'Kaaz's power was such that
  without Blackmourne's aid, Sagece could never have defeated him. 
  Morpheous was deeply saddened by the destruction of his high priest, but
  imagine his horror when he went to claim the body, and saw that a wound  
  that could only have come from the blade of his own godly brother! He
  wept, my brethren. Morpheous disappeared from view with the sorry
  remains of our leader. I do not know what will happen now, but the
  skies seem to be holding their breaths. Pray, my brethren.

                                In Yr. Service

~
extradesc: section5
These pages of the book face a painting, beautifully rendered, of 
some sort of aerial explosion on a scale unimaginable to mortal eyes.
The text, written in a spidery script, reads:

  My brethren, there is again peace in our land, but at such a cost I
  hesitate to relay the story to you, for fear you will think I have
  taken leave of my senses.

  The All-Father himself, Metamorpho, appeared out of swirling mists
  when the city of Templace was destroyed. He was burning with the most
  holy wrath one can imagine, as terrible as an army with banners. He
  took up Morpheus, Blackmourne, and Angus, and all was quiet, save for
  the cries of the wounded. I tried my best to heal whom I could, but my
  strength was nearly gone. Like everybody on the field -- demon, human,
  and victim alike -- I carefully watched for the gods' return.

  When they did return, our gracious lord Morpheous, still holding the
  broken body of our Girr'Kaaz, performed a rite none have ever seen.
  Elia was furious that she could not perform the funeral rites, but
  she loves Morpheous as much as a human heart can love a god, so she
  allowed Morpheous to set his binding upon the world. The sky sparkled
  both with the power of the enchantment, and with the presence of many
  other gods, some of whom were newborn, some old and dear presences.
  They put their seal upon the ceremony. When it was over, Girr'Kaaz's 
  body turned to a kind of faerie-light that scattered all over the
  world. I write you only what I have seen, brethren.

  The gods did disappear just afterward, though I think Morpheous gazed
  upon the battlefield a short while. The Kaaz clan, what was left of it,
  scattered as well. I have not seen any of them since the battle.

  So that is where we are now, my brethren. Our mission is to rebuild
  this sorely shattered world and finish erasing the evils brought here
  by those whose greed nearly shattered everything we hold dear. If you
  happen to meet one of the Kaaz, do not alarm them, but report their
  movements to the Guild. I pray for their mental healing.

                          In Yr. Service,
                          Ausentharn, A Priest of the Northlands

extradesc: small sun minature glowing orb glass ball
This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside
of the ball cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small
sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

Some of the pages seem to be marked, in particular page16 and page37
which talk about future directions for more powerful spellcasters and
how to encode a simple cipher respectively.

The preface briefly states how essential it is for a spellcaster to
protect his spells against accidental or deliberate theft, by encoding
them.
~
extradesc: page16
A passage has been circled on this page, it reads:
    ...so in order to ensure that the magic user has a copious supply of
willing subjects for his experiments, he must first ingratiate himself with
his chosen town by generous acts. An intelligent mage will try and get
himself accepted into the council, and perhaps even move for a law which can
be used to aid him. This could state that all mad people be locked up, or
all criminals be killed. We all know how easy it is to turn a mind to madness
and the mage may then take these subjects 'under his protection' and
experiment on them without worry, as the populace soon forget what has
happened to them...

There is also a note in the margin which seems to be a calculation of some
sort and a reference to page23.
~
extradesc: page23
Ack, its a recipe for unlimited power, but it involves several unsavoury
ingredients including human organs. A passage has been circled on this page
too, and it reads:
    ...obviously in order to get this many human hearts is impossible
which is why this spell still remains theoretical, although if one were
to perfect some sort of cloning technique, coupled with a spell for creation
of a human, then it might be possible to create a human with many vestigial
organs which would presumably still be valid for the recipe...

Your skin crawls as you continue to read, anyone who really thought this
sort of stuff would work would have to be mad right?
~
extradesc: page37
There are some simple ciphers on the page here, and some notes in the margin
which look like the would have continued onto page 38, only that page has
been torn out of the book! You read the notes anyway and puzzle over the
missing data:
    ...and as has been known through history the simplest cipher is a
substitution whereby one letter is substituted for another (for example
the next letter in the alphabet) and the message is rewritten. The decoder
knows that the letters are shifted by a certain number of positions and
can easily decode the message. This is known as a monoalphabetic cipher. A
more complex 'polyalphabetic' cipher such as the Vigenere cipher may also
be used. The illustration on the next page shows this in action, but basically
the implementation is as follows:
     1) the keyword is chosen and repeatedly written below the phrase to be encoded
     2) the combination of keyword letter and phrase letter are used to index  the Vigenere tableau
     3) the indexed letters form the encoded phrase
And the decryption works in reverse, going down the column indexed by the
keyword letter to the encoded letter, and determining which letter heads that
row. Obviously a keyword of all 'a' would not encrypt at all.
The page ends here!

These wings look so real! A metallic golden frame supports two

are woven into the silk, making the wings shimmer as they move.

   It is a fine bracelet that looks like it was carved from one
large pearl, with a twisting whorled design inlaid with gold. It
fits over the wrist, sliding on without a clasp or hinge. It glows
with the lustrous inner light that only the finest pearls have.

This odd little draconian scale is burning with some sort of internal fire,

These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit! A tie-waist secures
them at the waist, and the thick woolen material goes from there all the
way down to your feet. They look quite old, and seem to glow with some
kind of magical power. Perhaps they're enchanted!
