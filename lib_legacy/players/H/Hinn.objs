This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

The gloves each feature 3 long blades originating from the top of the hand.

making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

no apparent straps used to leash it to your face.  It seems that the smoke is
wrapping around your hands as if to hold on, so it might do the same for your

extradesc: book
The worn out leather book binding is almost falling apart.  It is very old
and the leather is well oiled from being handed by unclean hands.  The pages in
the book are hand written with a variety of inks giving light to the idea that
the pages were written on different days as if a journal would be.  You can
read a few of the first pages: page1, page2 and page3.
~
extradesc: page3
For all that are powerful
Bringing fists down on the weak
Smashing their souls
And breaking the meek

May they soon meet their maker
Brought forth for their misdeed
Wrought down into the ground
Stomped flat their greed

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence 
Then let us to ascend
~
extradesc: page1
   The quaint sounds of spring fill my ears with a joy not found else where.  
The breeze showers my skin with the sensations of the air.  This feeling
empowers me with the creativity that is unrivaled by others.  Like floating on
top of the world without the weight of gravity to pull me down.

extradesc: page2
............THOUGHTS............
   Thoughts drain like water
  Down into the consciousness 
   Collected in a small form
Then spread out to be recollected 
  Rearranged and transformed 
Until they collide with perfection 
     Forming what would be
          What could be
 The greatest thought of them all

extradesc: trinket leather tattered
   The small scrap of leather has been worn beyond belief.  Its edges are
frayed and it is very soft to the touch.  There is a very small portion of a
picture that is crafted onto it, lending to the certainty that it is from a
larger piece of artwork.  Judging from the condition of the leather, this has
been around a long time, and held regularly as someone's good luck trinket.

   The bracelet is formed from small beads of gold and grayish colored stones.
It is very old and shows the marks from years of use.  The stone beads are
cracked and worn down on the edges and a few of them have chipped apart.  The
gold beads are starting to tarnish and fade, almost matching the dull luster of
the stone, from prolonged contact with the sweat from the skin.

This backpack is able to contain a large selection of goods, but its bulky
size makes it quite heavy. It is crafted from a fine waterproof leather,
and seems capable of resisting most adverse weather conditions.

These guantlets have smoldered in the heat of a black flame for many ages, as

They are solid and well fashioned, yet appear to have degraded in the flames
over the years.

This beautiful cloak is made of some kind of silky white fabric
sewn all over with the most amazing white feathers. Each full,
white feather has a single dark blue dot near its tip, giving
the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to
dappled. The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body, with
a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at
the waist.

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.

shoulders and worn as a mantle.  One end is even slightly weighted, making it
fall gracefully into artistic folds, barely visible.

This small bronze incense burner can be either held by a long handle,
or allowed to stand on 3 small legs. Smoke generally seeps out under its
hood, smelling of heady incense, and as long as it burns incense, it will
glow. An uneven green patina ripples across its surface.

These finely ground lenses must be gnomish work, for they seem to be flawless.
The rims are a thin silver and the nosepiece seems quite comfortable.  They
would surely be a great help to someone who has no near-vision that wants to
read a book or crochet or do anything else that requires them to see things
close up.

An airy-light robe of the finest silk shimmers and shines in the light,
reflecting many colors that change as it is moved.  Every color in the rainbow
is represented here and there, though if the fabric is moved the colors shift
again.  It looks like it is all made of one solid piece of fabric, hemmed only
at the collar and the sleeves.  It looks like it would be loose but comfortable

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.
