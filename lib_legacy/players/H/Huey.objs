     Made of a thin, stretchy material lined with a warm layer of fuzzy down,
these sleeves would be perfect for keeping your arms warm beneath your
overcoat.  However, the thin material would provide little benefit for warriors
and might seem even a bit sissified for the more beastly of occupations.  The
thin material has enough stretch to it that you might even be able to wear the
sleeves about your legs like a pair of tights in a stretch (no pun intended!)

extradesc: cloak winged feathers pile
     This warm, large garment is tailored entirely from feathers.  Upon closer
examination, the cloak looks to be made up of a long cape and two wings
attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.

extradesc: dragon fist mace broken
You've heard stories about this weapon, barely whispered stories told by 
warriors who were lucky to escape alive from the Dragon Cult, located far 
from here. It's made of something that looks like steel, but is much 
lighter, lucky for you! The end of the mace is shaped like a dragon's 
slightly clenched clawed forefoot. But it's fallen on hard times--its 
handle is broken, and its surface chipped slightly, affecting its heft 
and balance. It's still quite usable, though no experienced warrior 
would be interested in wielding it, since its power is greatly reduced 
because of its condition. But a junior trainee would be thrilled to have 
this once-impressive weapon.

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.

     The beak of a parrot, this grey hook-shaped bill has razor-sharp edges
honed daily by its former owner.  Though most birds are not aggressive, only
the most foolhardy would not look to its own defense.  It looks as if someone
has drilled two holes in the sides of the beak and run a leather thong through
them so that you could tie the hookbill onto your head; it might also function
well as a kind of dagger in hand.

The long wooden oval frames support your feet on interlaced thongs, and 
strap on by way of leather buckles. They don't look very impressive, but 
they sure do look effective in helping you traverse the killingly cold 
snow of the arctic fields -- and they might protect you a little bit too.
