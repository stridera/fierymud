Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

Not much more than a sliver from a much larger dragonscale, the surface of this
shard still has the lustery glitter of its original wearer.  The edges are
marred by jagged claw-like marks though, as if the shard were torn from the
whole scale by force.  A tiny pin on the back of the shard makes it easy to
clip onto a cloak or tunic.  A small dragon claw is etched into the clip.

The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky
finger, but its detail is exquisite, with every scale on the claw painfully

extradesc: tights purple purple-tights snug-fitting pair rolled ball discarded
These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit! A tie-waist secures
them at the waist, and the thick woolen material goes from there all the
way down to your feet. They look quite old, and seem to glow with some
kind of magical power. Perhaps they're enchanted!

This lone horn is very large and curved.  It is cracked and broken in two
places: a large break marks the spot where it was wrenched from the mighty
demon Krisenna's head, and a smaller break is higher up.  The smaller end is
worn, as if the horns were smoothed after the injury.  Whether this was done in
battle or for vanity is impossible to tell.  Some power remains in the horn,
damaged as it is.

Made of beaten gold and shaped into the fearsome visage of a scowling demon,

upon it, the demon's face is both ugly and true to form.  Perhaps it was
modeled after a real demon.

as a light source.
