   The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow. Gazing 
into its crystalline depths, there seems to be insubstantial forms 
floating within it. Before you can decide what lies within, you are 
forced to look away, lest its light blinds you.

extradesc: book enchiridion ench
The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time
itself -- that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater
than any the world has ever known, true love and blackest hatred,
friendship and betrayal.. all couched in the language of ancient
times to form a manual of behavior for magicians in the aftermath
of a war the likes of which may never be seen again... Though the
majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out or damaged,
enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.
~
extradesc: cover
The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.
~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.
~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.
~

This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small
caption near the bottom of the page reads "NAU I S". That is all you
can tell for sure.

The book is large and heavy, and is sealed with red wax.  Large, golden words
are set in its cover.  There is a tingling sensation as you touch this tome,
making you realise that this must be a book of power.  One of its stories tells
of a visit from a band of powerful sorcerers who were impressed with Neris'
kindness and presented her with a holy scarab that has some power to it.  The
leader of the sorcerers is shown speaking aloud to Neris refering to her as
"Neris'Kaan", or "Neris the Kind".

extradesc: bracelet seer
Forged from solidified magic, this bracelet is the embodiment of true magical
power.  Iridescent colors glint off the bracelet, which has a soft internal
glow of its own.  The surface of the bracelet slides and reacts when touched,
like oil on water, swirling the colors with the movement.

Being in the presence of something like this is enough to know that deep arcane
powers have been placed in this skullcap.  Made from simple cloth and studded
with small aquamarines, it is not only very beautiful, it is capable of
handling some of the most powerful enchantments.  This one is dedicated to
seeing and clarity of vision.
