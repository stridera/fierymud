It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside

places: a large break marks the spot where it was wrenched from the mighty
demon Krisenna's head, and a smaller break is higher up.  The smaller end is
worn, as if the horns were smoothed after the injury.  Whether this was done in
battle or for vanity is impossible to tell.  Some power remains in the horn,
damaged as it is.

When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

A brown husk protects the white meat of this nutty fruit from predators.  The
inside is also filled with a creamy, sweet milk-like liquid.  It's used as an

surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts

How grotesque.  Some person's face - sex now indistinguishable - was stripped
to provide this awful covering.  No hairs remain on it anywhere, and it has
been tanned to prevent deterioration and to give it a supple, smooth feel.  
The eyelids are missing, and small strings are attached which go around the
wearer's ears.

resembling lash marks.  An unfamiliar symbol on the doll's forehead glows

This shield is made of bright blue-white steel, but it glows with
a faint pink aura. The design on the front is ancient and very
familiar, though you can't immediately place it for now. And if 
you put your ear against its softly thrumming surface, you can
hear what seems to be a lullaby, in a strong female voice touched
with gentleness.

   A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.

extradesc: green elvin dagger
This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.

The dagger's blade is so narrow it seems as though you could easily snap
the weapon in two. However, when you test the strength of the weapon you find
it is quite strong. The edge of the dagger is razor sharp. Clearly, this
would make an ideal backstab weapon.

This breastplate is made of a magically hardened ice called ice-steel
because it takes on the strength of steel.  It is as light as ice and has
hard as steel. Embossed on the surface of the breastplate in a strange red
ice is the symbol of the cult of Tri-Aszp: a bleeding dragon's claw.

After unfolding the old paper, a small map of the Eastern wing of the
Reservation presents itself to you.  You can see a small path leading up to
some secret level, that can be reached through what looks like a trapdoor.  
The key below the map is completely worn away, leaving no clue as to what rooms
lead where.
