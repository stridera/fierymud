The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!

      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)

These work boots are made of dark brown leather. They go about calf-high,
and though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled
along its edges. They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable
for anybody wanting some basic protection.
