There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

Not much more than a sliver from a much larger dragonscale, the surface of this
shard still has the lustery glitter of its original wearer.  The edges are
marred by jagged claw-like marks though, as if the shard were torn from the
whole scale by force.  A tiny pin on the back of the shard makes it easy to
clip onto a cloak or tunic.  A small dragon claw is etched into the clip.

The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky
finger, but its detail is exquisite, with every scale on the claw painfully
chiseled into the metal.  The claw has a burning blue color, its glow somehow

Grotesque and ugly, the severed goat's head oozes blood from its neck just
below the jawbone.  Its whitish hair is stained and matted, clumping and
sticking in knots.  A limp pinkish tongue droops out of its mouth between rows
of vicious-looking teeth, forming a puddle of horrid-smelling drool beneath it.

As you look at the large white dragon's egg, you seem to remember something you
heard long ago.  Something about how a dragon's egg had special powers.  Now
what was that.

extradesc: cloak white feathers swan princess
This beautiful cloak is made of some kind of silky white fabric
sewn all over with the most amazing white feathers. Each full,
white feather has a single dark blue dot near its tip, giving
the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to
dappled. The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body, with
a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at
the waist.

The baton feels extremely cool to the touch, as if its brushed metal
surface is pulling all the heat from its surroundings.  It feels
hollow and perfectly balanced, yet the metal seems to be somewhat
stronger than anything this light should be.
