This is no natural gem!  It's the eye of a Hiver Queen, detached from its
socket.  The many eye facets that once gazed upon the world with ambitious lust
still gleam faintly in death.~

A shiny disc of polished steel makes the main part of this piece of armor.  
Tooled across its edges with a scrolling design, everything about it, from the
subtle decorations to the fine straps, makes it look expensive and highly
effective.  There are only a few little dents in its surface to mar its
mirror-like perfection.~
