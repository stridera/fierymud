This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

These boots are made from hardened leather, dyed black and covered with steel
chains.  Eerily not a clink or a clank sounds off these boots, which make them
perfect for sneaking while armored.  In addition, they are very light, which
keeps them from impeding movement.  A pair of boots like this would be a
perfect gift for anyone who valued stealth and quickness.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

kind of magical power. Perhaps they're enchanted!

extradesc: black leather drow boots
This grand pair of customized drow boots appears to have just been completed
after many hours and days of labor.  The flawless leather straps glisten with
every bit of light that crosses its surface.  The extra cushioning and soft
padding along the sole ensure that these boots are not only comfortable, but
very protective.

These wings look so real! A metallic golden frame supports two

the point of being almost transparent. Some kind of sparkly things
are woven into the silk, making the wings shimmer as they move.

extradesc: large black scrap cloth bracer assassin
This 'scrap' of cloth is actually a perfect rectangle and has nicely finished
edges and small, nearly invisible cords hanging from two sides.  In addition,
it seems to be reinforced with bands of padding, making it comfortable to wear.
It could easily be tied to the forearm, and would probably blend in well with
the darkness.

Made out of pure shadow, a coif like this allows the wearer to do more than
hide; they gain the senses of the shadows themselves.  Prized by rogues and
assassins alike, a coif like this is rarely found, but given to a person who
has advanced to the highest ranks in their guild.

These sleeves flow like velvet but have the weight of a lighter fabric.  They
rest quietly against any surface and allow for movement without making a sound.
Magic was clearly involved in their creation for no normal fabric offers these
kinds of benefits without any drawbacks.

splay apart.  At their far end, a gradiated strip of brass curves from one to
the other in an eighth of a circle.  It appears to be an octant, which is used
to find one's location out at sea, with the help of the stars.
