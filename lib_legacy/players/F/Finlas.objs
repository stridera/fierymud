extradesc: kimono black-cotton jet-black-kimono
Made of thin black cotton, this kimono blends in perfectly with the shadows of
night.  Silk would provide a telltale sheen, though it would also be lighter,
but the black-dyed cotton absorbs light rather than reflecting it.  It is
utterly silent, not even giving the usual "whoosh" of fabric when moved.  The
sleeves fall only to the elbows, providing plenty of room to swing a weapon.  ~

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  The tattoo is a highly realistic black image
of a hawk's wing, with intricate details that capture the texture and shape of
the feathers.  The use of shading and highlights creates a sense of depth and
movement in the feathers.  It incorporates intricate swirls in the details of
the feathers, evoking the image of the moving air.~
