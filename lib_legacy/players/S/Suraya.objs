Warm to the touch and bright as the morning light, this small ring seems to
have no physical structure or support.  It appears to have been made of light
fused into a semi-solid and stable shape that adjusts naturally in size.~

The golden elven leaves sparkle without reflecting any light.  The glinting
appearance comes from the ring itself, and would probably serve to warm the
finger it is worn on.~

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes are
strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads.  Here and there little
strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form interesting
geometric designs.  This necklace is a charm from the Wizardess Thekra; you

This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

giving the impression of thousands of tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into
its brocade surface.  It's quite heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held
together by a bronze clasp, beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon
whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you
look at it, touch it.~

pinpoints of luminescence contained in some kind of crystalline matrix.  They
swirl and float, giving a cosmic life to each disc.  Surely a treasure like

extradesc: feather garuda-feather shining-blue-feather sparkly-blue-feather pen quill
It's a gorgeous wing feather from the rare ice garuda.  Slightly chilly to the
touch, this kind of feather is prized among cryomancers for use as a quill.  
The sparkles are really tiny ice crystals embedded in the feather.~

pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

extradesc: staff staff-disintegration-staff glorious-yew-staff-radiating-devastating-might earth acid
This glorious staff, fashioned from a length of yew nearly the size of an adult
human, represents pinnacle mastery over the very essence of elemental earth
itself.  It is capable of using the forces of the earth to pull apart and
disintegrate any object or creature it encounters.  Decorated heavily with
runes and sigils of earth and death and topped with a large pure emerald, the
staff is an exquisite masterwork of elemental craftsmanship - the perfect
synthesis of art and magic.~

It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~
