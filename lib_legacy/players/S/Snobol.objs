extradesc: amulet gold silver glowing complete QUEST_OBJECT
This is an amulet with two breaks in the holding around the large jewel fixed
in the center.  The amulet looks as if it has been molded together and held in
place by some magical force.  The chain is a lushious silver color and the
holder of the bright green gem is a rich golden metal.    
There is a small inscription reading:
A gift to they who completed me.

Of all things, dragon skin is incredibly rare.  The scales are hard and a dark

extradesc: bracers-loong embellished-sapphire-bracers chinese-dragon-bracers
Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

Is it real fabric?  Hard to say, since this cloak seems to be constantly on
fire, sending up plumes of smoke to obscure its wearer.  It seems like a simple
wide-weave, thick-threaded back cloak, except for the heat dripping off the
fabric like oil.  The favor of the dark gods is said to be bestowed with items
like this, for the sulferic fumes are surely hellish in origin.

Wish I had better news, When I took over from zzur, the older backup player@0 files
never made it to our new server.  I've contacted Zzur about 10 times over the last
couple years, asking if he might have a copy, and he's ignored all my requests
I remember you, and have no problems hooking you up with new characters
that are **, but the old ones are gone.  Sorry, wish I had better news.

Thanks

hey, I did see you pop on the other day, but you were gone before
I could @0catch you
I see you still have a 101 lev character, I'm much different than zzur, 
I trust the guys that are imms, if you want to have your mortals on while
your reg chars are on, I don't care.
I'm fine with you advancing your chars, (and setting skills / attribs for your remort)
if you don't still have the commands, let me know, and I'll bump your level.
