   The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow. Gazing 
into its crystalline depths, there seems to be insubstantial forms 
floating within it. Before you can decide what lies within, you are 
forced to look away, lest its light blinds you.

extradesc: memento lover's lovers lovers-soul soul locket platinum
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.

   A large axe head is firmly attached to one end of a 7 feet long pole. 
It appears to be a rather old version of this weapon, as the axe blade 
lacks the spike with which to thrust at an opponent.

   You cannot see the form of the sword clearly, it seems to waver between 
the physical and ethereal plane. Though its appearance is insubstantial, 
the feel of the weapon is very much solid, well balanced, as well as 
sharp.
