extradesc: crest feathered
     Long yellow and grey feathers make up this piece of stylish headwear.
Upon the pate of some hapless bird it must have been beautifully expressive,
as the crest itself would swing up or lie back against the bird's head to
express interest, excitement, fear, and love.  Holding the feathered garment in
your hands, you cannot help but feel sorry for the bird and wonder if you might
be able to recreate even a degree of its vitality.

     These fine pants are made of a light fabric to which are sewn hundreds of
soft feathers.  The plumage looks to have come from all sorts of birds, with
long blue and green feathers likely from parrots lined up beside the smaller
browns, whites,  and greys of birds like finches and budgerigars.  Though their
value as armor might be questionable, the breeches do look to be rather warm
and even comfortable - and a must-have for every dandy's wardrobe!

The cloak is heavy and looks very warm, except for some ripped spots. The 
holes might have come from some sharp object, and though it's been 
carefully cleaned, probably by some freezing soldier, you can see the 
remains of bloodstains around the holes' edges. You consider wearing it 
yourself, since it still looks somewhat servicable.

This beautifully curving feather is a deep royal blue, just like the kingfisher
it comes from.  It's a primary flight feather from the left wing, so it would
probably make an excellent writing pen.

extradesc: millet spray food
     A slender brown stem supports a wide blossom of tiny seeds, giving the
millet spray the appearance of a cat's tail even down to the fuzzy filaments
growing all about the seeds much like tiny hairs.  Though perhaps the millet
does not look all that appetizing to you, to birds it is a treat on par with
ice cream and other unhealthy sweets.  Many a feathered flier can be seen about
the aviary picking away at the tiny but tasty seeds well into the evening
hours.
