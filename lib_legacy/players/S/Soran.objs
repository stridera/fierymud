When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

This is the Cailaran Vest, which you've heard of in stories, seen in tapestries
and paintings, even idly imagined seeking (and finding).  It's a long green
vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and flowing to the calves.
The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in golden thread in a criss-cross
pattern.  The double-breasted collar is embroidered as well, in golden
four-pointed stars.  It'd look perfect with a silk blouse and breeches.~

This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~
