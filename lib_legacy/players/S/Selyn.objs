It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes are
strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads.  Here and there little
strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form interesting
geometric designs.  This necklace is a charm from the Wizardess Thekra; you
recognize it at once.~

A small ball of light glows from an unknown source, but somehow still 
remains attached to a shining platinum chain.  It looks like a common 
necklace, except for the small glint of light that emits tiny beams that 
illuminate the palm of your hand.  Occasionally the light grows brighter for 
an instant, then fades back to normal.  ~

fur, preventing the frigid white metal from touching skin.  The plate metal is
slightly curved and much thinner than average steel, undoubtedly created by
some uncomprehensible elven miracle.~

together by a bronze clasp, beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon
whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you

It is very old and shows the marks from years of use.  The stone beads are
cracked and worn down on the edges and a few of them have chipped apart.  The
gold beads are starting to tarnish and fade, almost matching the dull luster of
the stone, from prolonged contact with the sweat from the skin.~

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

Salt is one of the oldest and simplest spices known to man.  In some ancient
lands, soldiers were paid in salt.  It is used to preserve meat and usually
makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,
just sitting around.  It is the most common spice.    ~

The flower resembles a perfect looking daisy, and is yellow in color.
The flower smells good enough to eat, and just looking at it makes you
kind of hungry. The more you study the flower, the more it looks like
some type of magical food, rather than a real flower. ~

This relatively simple mace is almost completely unadorned.  It is perfectly
smooth simple steel on well-varnished wood, lacking almost any distinctive
characteristics.  It radiates no magic, which is often the case of artifacts of
supreme power.  A single inscription is written around the base of the mace
head, where it attaches to the haft.~
extradesc: inscription
The inscription reads: "I am the phoenix who guides the souls to the
Netherworld when they go forth.  " It is clear this mace serves one purpose and
one purpose only: to send the souls of the unquiet dead back to their eternal
rest.~
