The charm is shaped into a little silver figurine of a deer, of a size suitable
to put onto a lady's charm bracelet.  It dangles from a bit of chain, but not
enough to wear around your neck, which is not a surprise.~

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

Sleeves which fall only to the elbow mark this as a men's-style kimono, unlike
the full-sleeved women's kimono.  This way, the wearer still has plenty of room
to handle a weapon.  Made of fine silk, it is meant to be worn loosely to allow
even greater freedom of movement.  Understated in its elegance, any warrior
would wear this robe with pride.    ~

The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over time, the color
was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light brown.  It's a simple two-piece
conical sort of hood, coming to a point well above the wearer's crown and
falling back.  A lively tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.~

This small clay seems anti-climatic for a healing potion though quite
suitable for a bandage.  It's doubtful that anything inside could save your

and symbols indicating their dark purpose and their masters, this dagger has
none of those traditional trappings.  A dagger made of blackened steel, sharp
yet unrefined, produced for one purpose only: to shed blood in the name of
Demon Lords.  On it is a single eye, a symbol of Yeenoghu, the Beast of
Butchery, so he may watch every kill up close.~

this shell would sell for a high price in any market, but do you really want to
part with the sea's breathtaking work of art?~

mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

severed from its body, clotted blood matting the edges of its hair.  A terrible
expression of wrath and anguish is locked onto its face, hinting at its
agonizing downfall.  Much of the insides of the head have long fallen out,
leaving a hideously gross interior large enough to fit another head in.    ~

Made of a raw, tan-colored silk that is much heavier than normal silk, the
kimono is patterned with leaves of red, yellow, orange, and brown.  The leaves
are embroidered on with silk thread, making them shine in the light.  The body
of the kimono must have been made of raw silk so that the textures, both
tactile and visual, would complement each other.  This robe is truly a work of
art.    ~

Made of thin black cotton, this kimono blends in perfectly with the shadows of
night.  Silk would provide a telltale sheen, though it would also be lighter,
but the black-dyed cotton absorbs light rather than reflecting it.  It is
utterly silent, not even giving the usual "whoosh" of fabric when moved.  The
sleeves fall only to the elbows, providing plenty of room to swing a weapon.  ~

This armor is so light that you wonder that it could be at all effective!  
Made from strips of bamboo cleverly lashed together with wire, it covers from
the throat to the knees.  It looks like it ties in the back.~
