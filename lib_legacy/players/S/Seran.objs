When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

Made of a thin, stretchy material lined with a warm layer of fuzzy down, these
sleeves would be perfect for keeping your arms warm beneath your overcoat.  
However, the thin material would provide little benefit for warriors and might
seem even a bit sissified for the more beastly of occupations.  The thin
material has enough stretch to it that you might even be able to wear the
sleeves about your legs like a pair of tights in a stretch (no pun intended!  
)~

This warm, large garment is tailored entirely from feathers.  Upon closer
examination, the cloak looks to be made up of a long cape and two wings
attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.~

decorates the wood, giving the wand a glittering appearance like a shower of

The beak of a parrot, this grey hook-shaped bill has razor-sharp edges honed
daily by its former owner.  Though most birds are not aggressive, only the most
foolhardy would not look to its own defense.  It looks as if someone has
drilled two holes in the sides of the beak and run a leather thong through them
so that you could tie the hookbill onto your head; it might also function well
as a kind of dagger in hand.~
