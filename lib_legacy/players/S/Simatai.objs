The torch is simple in its design. It's made up of a piece of wood with
some cloth wrapped around the top of it, and smells like it has been
dipped in oil.~

extradesc: iron rations
These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

This plain wooden staff is imbued with a peaceful feeling, making it useless in
combat.  But it does help one walk rather nicely.~

soles, these sandals look very durable.~
