This breastplate is made of steel and obsidian.  The breastplate itself is made

It edges are flied down so you don't hurt yourself while wearing this heavy
breastplate.  Its thickness shows that it would be very hard to penetrate with
any weapon.  As you look at the face of the breastplate you see a carving of a
blackthorn, the symbol of the dark monks.

A shimmering wave of transluscent energy has been shaped into a concave
bowl of protection. Faint swirls of gray, blue, and green wash through 
it in pulses like waves past an ocean shore.

These guantlets have smoldered in the heat of a black flame for many ages, as
in apparent by the perpetual signs of soot lingering in all of the crevices.  
They are solid and well fashioned, yet appear to have degraded in the flames
over the years.
