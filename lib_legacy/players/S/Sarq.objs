   The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is
both too bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.

   A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.

This lone horn is very large and curved.  It is cracked and broken in two
places: a large break marks the spot where it was wrenched from the mighty
demon Krisenna's head, and a smaller break is higher up.  The smaller end is
worn, as if the horns were smoothed after the injury.  Whether this was done in
battle or for vanity is impossible to tell.  Some power remains in the horn,
damaged as it is.

The gloves each feature 3 long blades originating from the top of the hand.  
When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.

Garlic is said to be able to ward off vampires.  It certainly will ward off
your friends if you eat too much of it, as it can cause very bad breath.  It
is, however, excellent at curing minor illnesses such as the common cold.

Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell

other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.
