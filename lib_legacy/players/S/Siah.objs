creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.

stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.
