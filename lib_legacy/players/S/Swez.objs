  The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand. It seems to light up
the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

The gloves each feature 3 long blades originating from the top of the hand.  
When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.

Armwraps like these would make for poor armor in any other situation, but in

strength and power.  The natural abilities of one such person come to the
forefront, increasing their defensive and offensive capabilities.

   The mask is not built from a solid material, but formed from a thick, dark
cloud of smoke.  The outline of the mask, as well as the eye holes can be seen
and even felt, giving it the illusion of being solid.  The smoke that swirls
around it is vividly dark and gloomy, creating a supernatural look.  There are
no apparent straps used to leash it to your face.  It seems that the smoke is
wrapping around your hands as if to hold on, so it might do the same for your
face.

extradesc: gloves blades bladed
The gloves each feature 3 long blades originating from the top of the hand.  
When wielding a weapon or making a fist, the long blades extend past the hand,
making it more difficult to block a blow without taking damage.  The blades
seem to be connected to a large metal plate sandwiched between two layers of
leather.  A wide strap allows one to tighten the whole apparatus to the hand for
stability.

extradesc: pliable tough strips leather monastic scriptures fistwraps master
The most powerful weapon a monk master can ever use is his fists, and these
wrappings prove that.  Meditation chants and order scriptures are written all
over these strips which can be laced around the hands, protecting them like
gloves and focusing all of a monk's energy into their strikes.  Written on one
strap is a dedication to the original bearer.

A simple strip of leather, long enough to be wrapped around the head twice and

It reminds the wearer of the principles of monastic life over the trappings of
fashion and material wealth.
