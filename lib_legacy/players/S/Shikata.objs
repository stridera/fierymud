silver teardrop is encircled with a thin copper wire and anchored to black
leather cord.  The tear is frigid to the touch and fills your mind with an

A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked
through.  The chain is rather long and would probably fit adventurers large and
small.~

hovering with a small amount of air between them and the ground on which they
rest.  The green-blue coloration seems to melt into any grass or earth they

themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.~

No ordinary doll, it has pale, translucent skin and black hair tinted slightly
blue.  A silvery light seems to glow about the doll, highlighting its
glittering indigo eyes.  Amusement shows in the capricious grin stitched on its
face.  A tiny glass shard is clasped in the doll's right hand, pyramidal in
shape and about as long as the doll's forearm.~
