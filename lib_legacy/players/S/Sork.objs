  The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand. It seems to light up
the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.

   The wand is jet black in colour, and it seems to absorb all the light that
falls on it. Etched on one end are the words :

It feels almost fluffy and very weightless.  It becomes more clearly defined in
the light, appearing to be more like black cloth, yet when in the shadows it
fades until it is barely visible.  Cloaked in shadow, it would be easy to
remain hidden wherever there is darkness.

The mandolin is fairly light for its size, made of a thin yet durable walnut
wood and skillfully stained in patterns of six-pointed flowers on the
teardrop-shaped sounding board.  The neck is also stained dark, and the tuning
pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.

You see a braided suede leather belt here. It's twice the length of your 
entire body. You've seen this type of belt before-- you're supposed to 
take it and wind it around your body twice, loop it in a specific way, 
and let the ends fall to your calves. It seems like it'd hamper your 
movement, if you did that, but perhaps it will benefit you to the point 
that you don't mind it doing that.

The writing on the wand is in an ancient elvish script and difficult to read,
but seems to describe the wand's contract and usage.  Tapping the wand's power
requires a binding and sacrifice as part of the contract with an unidentified

Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

This ceramic is a work of art. The green spider appears life-like, forever 
frozen in one position. The spider's ruby eyes sparkle in the light, the 
only sign that it is an artificial creation.

extradesc: crown gypsy
This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

Yup, your quest is still on record.  In case you no longer have the
origin@0al text, here it is:

The final power you shall gain in your magical studies is over the
mind.  Using this power is an delicate, complex process, but gaining
it is even more intricate.

First, become adept at quickly gaining strangers' trust.  Five items,
each with at least +5 charisma, will aid you in this.  Four
SHIMMERING items and one GLISTENING.  If those trinkets are not
sufficient to buy them over, you will need the two wands of charm
person to seal the deal.  Of course, after using these tactics a few
times, your targets will begin to catch on, so you must disguise
yourself with eight different MASKs.
Another way to become more charming is to become more beautiful.

I will let you in on a forbidden secret: it is possible to steal
the beauty of others and make it your own.  To accomplish this,
you must steal the souls of seven BEAUTIFUL and two PRETTY
maidens (actually one is a parrot).  When you have collected these,
I will teach you the forbidden spell to make yourself more charming
than humanly resistible.

This slender rapier is long, its blade not sharp but is point wickedly so.
It is made of some very bright alloy of steel that looks almost silvery,
and its hilt is wrapped in blue leather. The crossguard is the traditional
basket hilt, but very ornately done, sweeping and scrolling.

This odd little draconian scale is burning with some sort of internal fire,

fieryness into its holder, promising power and strength to its wearer.

scent of Christmas.  Various pine cones and berries are tied into the
wreath, and a large red bow on one side adds a vibrant splash of color
to the decoration.  The hole in the center is fairly wide, probably
large enough to fit over your head...

This dagger has a gleaming steel blade, but its most outstanding feature is
surely its faceted emerald hilt.  The quillions are elegantly tapered and curve
upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.
