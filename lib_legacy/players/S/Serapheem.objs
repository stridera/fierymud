This large tattoo covers half the face, and is shaped like a cat's striking
paw, claws extended as if about to rend across the cheek from eyebrow to
jawline.  It's an impressive piece.~

extradesc: wand lesser-wand-lightning-wand simple-aspen-wand
This short wand is made from a single slim branch of an aspen tree.  The rough,
powdery white bark of the branch is left natural, the dark cracks forming
lighting bolt-like images along its length, exposing the pale white wood
underneath.  One end comes to a naturally terminating point; the other is
wrapped in light leather and bolted into place.  The wand is otherwise
unadorned.  A small tag is attached to the wand.~

This bone is under a foot long, and clearly comes from the leg of an
unfortunate gnome.  It's highly polished, as if it were extensively handled.  
An inscription, apparently burned into the surface of the bone, starts near the
middle and spirals toward the thick end.  Its language is unknown to you.~
