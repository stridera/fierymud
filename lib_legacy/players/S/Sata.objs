This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.  It is
enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside of the ball
cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small sun, radiating
bright light in all directions.  If you have this item, luck, determination and
the Gods are with you.~

This is an amulet with two breaks in the holding around the large jewel fixed

place by some magical force.  The chain is a luscious silver color and the
holder of the bright green gem is a rich golden metal.
 
There is a small inscription reading:

extradesc: memento-lover's-soul memento-lovers-soul platinum locket
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    ~

"My thought will be for you

This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

its brocade surface.  It's quite heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held
together by a bronze clasp, beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon
whose raised fists make the clasp circular in form.  The ankle-length cloak is
lined in black silk and edged in crimson.  Your blood stirs inside you as you
look at it, touch it.~

but no other blemishes are visible on the exterior of the mask.  The mask's
surface is extremely cold to the touch--perhaps it is worn by freezing itself
to the wearer's face?~

extradesc: doll miniature-frost-stallion-doll tiny-proud-white-horse
This slender-legged, bright white doll has a look of nobility in its
well-crafted stitches.  Clumps of stuffing ripple under its skin and its
underlying wire frame allows the doll to stand on its four little legs with
grace and assuredness.~

The shaft of this pickaxe is made of some odd material, and so is the blade of
the pickaxe.  Obviously someone has spent a lot of hard work creating this
rather odd tool.  There appear to be some initials scratched on the bottom of
the pickaxe.~

The initials read E.A.~

extradesc: mandolin wooden-instrument teardrop-shaped-body tear-drop questobject
The mandolin is fairly light for its size, made of a thin yet durable walnut
wood and skillfully stained in patterns of six-pointed flowers on the
teardrop-shaped sounding board.  The neck is also stained dark, and the tuning
pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.~

It's just a simple woolen pouch. The fabric is dyed a brilliant
red color, and there's some embroidery on its front. A cord closes
around the pouch's neck; the cord is quite long, long enough for
you to tie its ends around your belt.~
extradesc: embroidery
The embroidery is of a strange kind. Usually embroidery is of
pretty things, for some sort of informative or decorative purpose,
but this picture is of a monstrous golden wolf-like beast with
eerily human eyes.~

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn

of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same
way that a deadly sword is beautiful. She's exactly like a sword --
whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.~

Regarding the status of your request.  House Z'Kenian is more than
willing to trade soulsteel in exchange for thawkinixa, however
be aware that this is done without sanction of the city's ruling
body, House Kar'Shezden.  As such, we are unable to comply with the
second part of your request and we are unable to free the city's
troll slaves in exchange for dwarven ones softened by mind control
tactics.  The secret of forging adamantium must likewise remain
with the drow until further negotiations can be made.
Should you find these conditions acceptable, please respond with
all haste.
We await your reply.~

mobs AND either "the mist" on trophy, or 6 ways you tried to kill it that
didn't work.  Also 8 alcoholic beverages and one "mist" item.  Lastly, one mob
on trophy whose composition is mist, but that does not respond to "mist".  
Complete these tasks and your reward will be great.  -Kourrya, Devourer of

extradesc: circlet silvery-circle pale-circlet
Translucent yet solid, the circlet is made of some unknown material, definitely
magical in nature.  When it touches light, it shimmers oddly, almost sparkling.
Cool to the touch, it hums faintly and radiates a sense of calm to anyone near
it.~

Feather-light silk is artfully sewn into leggings, gathered at the waist and
tied with a light string of the same fabric.  The silk is many-colored,
changing as it is moved and shimmering in the light.  They look like they would
be rather baggy, but comfortable - how not, as they are made of the finest
silk?~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for

the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.~

You hold a simple, small crystal stick.  It has a brilliant streak of red
running through its center.  The red glows slightly.~

This is no natural gem!  It's the eye of a Hiver Queen, detached from its
socket.  The many eye facets that once gazed upon the world with ambitious lust
still gleam faintly in death.~

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.~

You see a cuff made of large, rectangular-cut rubies pieced side by side to
form the cuff itself.  A strong-looking clasp holds the cuff together.  The
gemstones are of the highest quality-- pigeon's-blood-red, clear as crystal,
with not a flaw present to the eye.  As you look closer, you can see that each
gem is housed in a copper-colored setting.~

Crafted from a solid shard of hardened night, the ring refuses to let even
light caress it.  The band is thin yet does not seem weak by far.  A small
place at the top feels very thick and round.  At a straight look it is almost
like one could see movement from inside.~

A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.~

Constructed from a large bough of an evergreen tree, twisted back upon itself

Christmas.  Various pine cones and berries are tied into the wreath, and a
large red bow on one side adds a vibrant splash of color to the decoration.  
The hole in the center is fairly wide, probably large enough to fit over your

Forged from solidified magic, this bracelet is the embodiment of true magical
power.  Iridescent colors glint off the bracelet, which has a soft internal
glow of its own.  The surface of the bracelet slides and reacts when touched,
like oil on water, swirling the colors with the movement.~

It's a small octagonal shield about the size of a human's hand with a two
ornate swords criss crossing over the top of it.  The bronze finish could use a
good cleaning one third of the shield and swords have been corroded, as if the
badge fell from its owner during the great battle for Templace and it was only
recently discovered partially buried.  The magic once lent to the guards still
courses through the badge bestowing its power to those who wear it.~

The mandolin is fairly light for its size, made of a thin yet durable walnut
wood and skillfully stained in patterns of six-pointed flowers on the
teardrop-shaped sounding board.  The neck is also stained dark, and the tuning
pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.~

The little doll is sewn together from scraps of cloth.  Facial features are
stitched carefully on the head, depicting a mischievous smile.  Something about
the doll just makes you want to pat it on the head!  A hooded cloak made of
brown felt fits the doll nicely, covering the seams where the arms are
attached.  Each arm has an odd little sword sewn on--the hilts are metallic,
but the blades are a strange glowing material.  The swords' glow slowly
alternates between subtle brightening and dimming, casting varying shadows on
the doll's face which seem to make its eyes come alive.~
