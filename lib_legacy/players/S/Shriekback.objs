This action figure appears to be an exact replica of Dakhod!  With a peg leg
and a hook for a hand, the attention to detail is stunning.  This action figure
comes complete with karate chop action when its legs are squeezed, and a
pullstring on his back.

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed

wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

Pog's notes on the Brushland Region:
Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food
make this area a haven for all sorts of creatures of the forest.

My soul is happy to see this.
