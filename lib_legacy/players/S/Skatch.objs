The golden elven leaves sparkle without reflecting any light.  The glinting
appearance comes from the ring itself, and would probably serve to warm the
finger it is worn on.

   A solid crystal attached to a silver chain looks like it is made of ice, and
indeed it is cool to the touch.  It does not melt when worn, an indicator that
it was probably made with magic.  The crystal itself has six-sided symmetry and
is a translucent pale blue-white, distorting objects slightly if looked

this face appears to have been peeled off whole from someone, then prepared to
be worn as some kind of hat.  The face feels moist, as if it was freshly

scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same

These are not so much slippers as they are actual hollowed out feet, chopped
off at the ankle!  The fur on them was obviously grown naturally before the
foot was severed, and has been expertly, if not magically, preserved.  
Stitched together like shoes so as to allow anyone to wear them, the
resemblance to halfling feet is unmistakable regardless.
