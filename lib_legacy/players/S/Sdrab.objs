The fur cloak is not very comfortable to wear but if it can protect you from
the cold, well, you just aren't complaining.~

As you look at the tapestry, your spirit rises from the sublime colors and
expert weaving of the piece, then falls, as you notice how ragged its edges
are, and how obviously neglected it is.  There's no way it can be repaired, you
see.  That's too bad.  If it were in better shape, it'd be worthy of a lord's
castle.  You might even want to put it in yours, if you ever get one.~

Examining the bracelet closer, you see images of fierce boars somehow printed
on it.  You're now quite sure how, or even what exact material the bracelet is
made of, though you suspect some kind of magically treated boar skin.~

extradesc: wreath christmas-wreath large-green-wreath
Constructed from a large bough of an evergreen tree, twisted back upon itself
into a large circle, this wreath smells with the wondrous winter scent of
Christmas.  Various pine cones and berries are tied into the wreath, and a
large red bow on one side adds a vibrant splash of color to the decoration.  
The hole in the center is fairly wide, probably large enough to fit over your
head...~
