The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over
time, the color was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light
brown. It's a simple two-piece conical sort of hood, coming to
a point well above the wearer's crown and falling back. A lively
tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.

extradesc: mushroom cap
This looks like the cap of a rather large mushroom.  It's big enough to cover
the top of a human's head!  It is dried, and the consistency of stiff leather.
It's a pale orange color, with barely visible white spots.
