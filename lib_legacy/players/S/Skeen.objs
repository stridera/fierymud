Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

extradesc: wings translucent pair faerie
These wings look so real! A metallic golden frame supports two
somewhat large wings made of some kind of silk that stretches to
the point of being almost transparent. Some kind of sparkly things
are woven into the silk, making the wings shimmer as they move.

The worn out leather book binding is almost falling apart.  It is very old
and the leather is well oiled from being handed by unclean hands.  The pages in
the book are hand written with a variety of inks giving light to the idea that
the pages were written on different days as if a journal would be.  You can
read a few of the first pages: page1, page2 and page3.

For all that are powerful
Bringing fists down on the weak
Smashing their souls
And breaking the meek

May they soon meet their maker
Brought forth for their misdeed
Wrought down into the ground
Stomped flat their greed

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence 
Then let us to ascend
~
extradesc: page1
   The quaint sounds of spring fill my ears with a joy not found else where.  
The breeze showers my skin with the sensations of the air.  This feeling
empowers me with the creativity that is unrivaled by others.  Like floating on
top of the world without the weight of gravity to pull me down.

............THOUGHTS............
   Thoughts drain like water
  Down into the consciousness 
   Collected in a small form
Then spread out to be recollected 
  Rearranged and transformed 
Until they collide with perfection 
     Forming what would be
          What could be
 The greatest thought of them all

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

Obviously enchanted, these greaves are made from a single steel plate covered
with small black chain links, yet they make absolutely no sound.  They play
tricks with the light, fading in and out of sight occasionally, making both
them and their wearer difficult to detect.
