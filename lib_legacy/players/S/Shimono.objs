Warm to the touch and bright as the morning light, this small ring seems to

fused into a semi-solid and stable shape that adjusts naturally in size.~

Smoky quartz is a powerful mystic matrix because it energizes like clear quartz
but also has strong connections to the realms of sleep and dreams.  Set in
silver, a ring like this provides powerful connections to both the moon and the
Reverie, making it highly prized by faeries and witches alike.~

This is an amulet with two breaks in the holding around the large jewel fixed
in the center.  The amulet looks as if it has been molded together and held in
place by some magical force.  The chain is a luscious silver color and the
holder of the bright green gem is a rich golden metal.
 
There is a small inscription reading:

This vest-like garment is something between a typical doublet and a corset,
ideal as the bodice for a formal gown or the vest of a fancy suit.  The heavy
brocade fabric provides a stiffness and stability a more traditional doublet
lacks without the boning of a full corset.  A loose rose motif typical of
Soltan work is woven in with lustrous threads.  It is trimmed with small pearl
bangles around the bottom and top edges, accentuated with golden fasteners.  
Truly a masterwork garment!~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

Brocade is a very uncommon material for shoes because of how dirty they can
get.  That makes shoes like these extraordinarily rare.  This pair of slippers
is fine brocade stitched over leather for both comfort and support.  The loose
woven pattern of a Soltan rose is accentuated with golden embroidery and
gemstone beads.  A lavish buckle decorates the face of the shoe.  A small

above the ears like spectacles The glass is of uneven thickness and shape, not
conforming to any specific geometry.  Only by holding them up to your eyes and
looking through them can you begin to see the subtle refraction of magical

These leggings are sublime and flowing, graceful and delicate.  Every sweep of
the leg, every turn of the foot perfectly accentuated, they're ideal for
someone living in the limelight.  A flare at the bottom heightens the movement
and the elegance even more.  They are woven with a prime symbol of high society
and class - a loose representation of the Golden Rose of Solta.~

These fine elbow-length velvet brocade gloves are woven with golden thread in
the loose rose pattern, iconic of finery from Solta.  Small beryl gems and
pearls are sewn on with small gold settings, adding both weight and beauty.  
They're soft and supple, and lustrous in every way.  They are the perfect gift
for a star of the stage.~

This bracelet is actually several very thin golden rings bound together with
gold wire.  It is decorated with fine rose motifs etched into the bands then
embellished with fine yellow citrines and carnelians native to the region
around Solta.  Reflected light glimmers in all directions like a star twinkling

This thin visor is cast from a mysterious white metal.  Apparently stronger
than steel, despite its thinness, it is almost impossible to deform.  A strap
hanging around the back allows the visor to be worn on the head to protect the
face.  Several vertical slits give the wearer a clear view of the surroundings.~

A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a

a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~

Examining this tiny light more closely, it becomes obvious this is no meager
glass or crystal.  It is the heart of a newborn star, breathed into creation
through divine providence.  Within it lay all the hopes and dreams of creation,
which perhaps could become another legendary soul, or a cosmic array of life
and potential.~

Shaped like a small artist's rendition of the sun, the core is made of a
brightly glowing yellow material that is cool to the touch despite the light it
sheds.  Extending from the core in four directions are flame-shaped reddish
copper rays.  It looks like it would make a fine identifying mark on a cloak.~

brightly glowing yellow material that is cool to the touch despite the light it
sheds.  Extending from the core in four directions are flame-shaped reddish
copper rays.  It looks like it would make a fine identifying mark on a cloak.~

It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~

extradesc: emerald brilliant-emerald green-gem-remarkable-beauty beautiful
It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~

Shaped in this glass is the face of a raging bear.  The mere sight of it's
terrible eyes are disturbing.  It seems so real!  It hums with the power of the
awful bear trapped inside it, barely contained.  You wonder if it's even safe
to handle.~

This small constellation is made up of three motes of light that seem to be
somehow bound to each other.  They gently pulse and twinkle like tiny stars.  
Surely such a bauble is from another world!~

This chunk of rock is about the size of a troll's fist and made of a deep

different shades ranging from dark moss to the pale green of new leaves.  It is
considered a soft stone, so it is possible that it was once polished but became
chipped.  However, this green stone is often found deep inside mountains.

As you peer into the globe you can see a courtyard and a tall tower amongst the
snow.  Hang on, little people shapes are MOVING in there.  This is very

people seem unaffected.    ~

wood and skillfully stained in patterns of six-pointed flowers on the

The mandolin is fairly light for its size, made of a thin yet durable walnut
wood and skillfully stained in patterns of six-pointed flowers on the
teardrop-shaped sounding board.  The neck is also stained dark, and the tuning
pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.~

since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is

A stem of silver with tiny thorns supports a gorgeous bud of sapphire, looking
as though it has barely begun to bloom.  It has a slight scent similar to that
of fresh rain wafting from the sapphire head, making it very pleasant to smell.
Inscribed on the stem are tiny holy symbols.~

extradesc: lyre saung exquisite black-gold-harp
As best as you can tell, this instrument is a harp of some kind.  It is
C-shaped, like the stave of a bow, with the wide mouth of the arc completely
open.  The bottom of the arc is a fat, wide base, anchoring 16 strings which
run from base to midsection of the harp.  It is lacquered black, capped on each
end with gold, and highly decorated with cords which help tighten and tune the
strings.~

A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a
grip, indicating that it could be used as a weapon.  Whether or not it would be
a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~

This mighty sword was the prized possession of the Lizard King, ruler of the
Great Northern Swamp.  Forged from mythril and enchanted in the depths of the
castle beneath the swamp, the sword was created to bring fire to the darkest of
places and burn all enemies before it.  It is truly a staggering weapon to
behold!~
