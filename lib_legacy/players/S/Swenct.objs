Crafted of a crude leather, and studded with metal knobs for added protection
against physical attacks.  They are a bit heavy, and far too encumbering for a

The creatures that fashioned these boots let nothing go to waste.  These orange
and yellow boots are very comfortable, you could walk all day in them.  The
thick skin and durable construction, would also offer you a fair degree of
protection in battle.~

This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light
is so bright as to hurt the eyes, yet it is only a bit warm to the touch.  
Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead
of glass.    ~
