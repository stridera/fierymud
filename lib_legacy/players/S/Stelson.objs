You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

extradesc: wings translucent pair faerie
These wings look so real! A metallic golden frame supports two
somewhat large wings made of some kind of silk that stretches to
the point of being almost transparent. Some kind of sparkly things
are woven into the silk, making the wings shimmer as they move.

extradesc: coral ring coral-ring
The coral ring seems totally flawless. It is made of the finest coral
you have ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white
on the other. It is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance
so that it is not the least bit abrasive.~

This jewel is the size of your fist! Beneath its multifaced surface you
perceive an intense reddish light so intense it seems a reflection of
Vulcera's fiery passion and hot desires.
