   The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is
both too bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.

   The main body of this exquisite ring is made of bright silver
that seems to glow aquamarine-blue with an inner light. The pearl
that adorns it is stunning and larger than usual, with deep blue
sapphires running otter-swift around the main center of attention.
The ring is neither wide nor narrow, making it wearable by either
men or women.

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed

wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

   The chestplate is pure silver in color, radiating in the light and
reflecting it back with a bit more intensity.  The metal has been polished and
kept very clean, even though there are minor imperfections such as sword marks
and small dents.  There are markings along the sides, etched into the metal.  
The markings bear the letters SH and are surrounded by runes of some sort.

   The mask is not built from a solid material, but formed from a thick, dark
cloud of smoke.  The outline of the mask, as well as the eye holes can be seen
and even felt, giving it the illusion of being solid.  The smoke that swirls
around it is vividly dark and gloomy, creating a supernatural look.  There are
no apparent straps used to leash it to your face.  It seems that the smoke is
wrapping around your hands as if to hold on, so it might do the same for your
face.

These fine, shiny sleeves are obviously of dwarven make. Finely
articulated, with copped elbows and oiled hinges, they are easy to
wear and strong enough to turn most injuries. They have straps at the 
top to attach to a breastplate or vest, and other buckles close them
under the arm, where the seam is.
