The coral ring seems totally flawless.  It is made of the finest coral you have
ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white on the other.  It
is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance so that it is not the
least bit abrasive.~

When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~
