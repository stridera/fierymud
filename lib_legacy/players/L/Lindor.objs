The coral ring seems totally flawless.  It is made of the finest coral you have
ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white on the other.  It
is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance so that it is not the
least bit abrasive.~

extradesc: kimono imperial-silk-robe thick red-embroidery
This kimono is heavier than it looks!  Upon closer inspection, you see that it
is really made of not one but twelve separate layers, from a golden silk
embroidered with red on the outermost to a plain white cotton underkimono on
the lowest layer.  How do people move wearing this many layers of clothing?  
It is a good thing the kimono is made to a loose-fitting design, or else they
wouldn't be able to.  Voluminous sleeves provide a hiding place for trinkets
and small, useful items without all that fuss about pockets.  Just being seen
in such a robe would surely elevate one's social status.    ~

These boots are fashioned from high quality leather, sturdy enough to provide
protection but soft enough to be comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
The soles are the thick soles of traveling shoes, the kind befitting a
wandering troubadour.  Making use of vibrant dyes however, the craftsman has
created a piece of gear that wonderfully combines function with aesthetic for
some flare on the go.~
