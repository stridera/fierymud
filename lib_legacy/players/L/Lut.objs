handling some of the most powerful enchantments.  This one is dedicated to
seeing and clarity of vision.

Of all things, dragon skin is incredibly rare.  The scales are hard and a dark
black color.  Each scale is the size of a man's kneecap, connected
mysteriously beneath.

extradesc: staff highpriest
This long staff is made of some sort of dark wood that tapers from the
top to the bottom, which is capped in black iron. Two sections of its
length are wrapped in leather strips, though the rest of it is covered
in a regular arrangement of thick thorns. The bulbous top of the staff
is covered in them. This weapon, for weapon it must be, has a good weight
and heft in the hand.
