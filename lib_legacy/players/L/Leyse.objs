This is the Cailaran Vest, which you've heard of in stories, seen in 
tapestries and paintings, even idly imagined seeking (and finding). It's 
a long green vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and 
flowing to the calves. The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in 
golden thread in a criss-cross pattern. The double-breasted collar is 
embroidered as well, in golden four-pointed stars. It'd look perfect with 
a silk blouse and breeches.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

extradesc: cloak-ancient-wisdoms thin-cloak
You behold a cloak made of some kind of thin, blood-red damasked silk 
embroidered over with dark blue silk thread in cunning designs. The 
collar is lined in thick, deep brown fur. You get the uncanny feeling 
that this flowing cloak isn't quite what it seems. It seems to have a 
sense of power to it. Some sense of intuition you didn't even know you 
had tells you to handle this cloak carefully.

The sword is rather small to be called a sword, but it's definitely bigger
than a dagger. It's rather simple in design.
