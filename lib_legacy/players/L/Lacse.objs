extradesc: crown gypsy-crown golden-crown-inlaid-emeralds emerald
This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive.  The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of crowns.
A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

This farm implement seems somehow more sinister than other sickles. Its
shaft is made of wood, with two sections wrapped in thongs. The blade is
quite long and similar in shape to a scimitar. It protrudes out from the
shaft quite some distance, then rounds back towards it in a vicious curve.
Overall, it seems like quite a clumsy weapon, but wielded properly, it
could do great damage.~

The Silveroak is a hardy, long-lived tree, but it rarely proliferates.  
Finding the seed of such a tree is truly a remarkable event.~

Examining the bracelet closer, you see images of fierce boars somehow printed
on it.  You're now quite sure how, or even what exact material the bracelet is
made of, though you suspect some kind of magically treated boar skin.~

It is very light, for a breastplate.  The metal hardly seems to weigh anything.
It is a very strange metal, formed of black and grey swirls that are
constantly, if slowly, moving.  Touching a swirl with one's bare hands gives
something of a shock, as if you had laid your bare hands against a trapped
soul.~

This is a six-foot length of dull black links.  The dark, sullen metal from
which they were forged reflects little light.  The links are nearly
rectangular, and lie almost flat due to a clever design.  The claw at the end
is rectangular as well, except that its pointed tine juts outward at a small
angle.  The claw is perhaps double the size of a link.  Stains and scratches
abound on this weapon.~

Bitter tears of regret, clenched tooth to bone.

extradesc: memento-lover's-soul memento-lovers-soul platinum locket
A small locket, barely larger than a fingernail, is nonetheless very valuable
as it is made out of the rare and precious metal platinum.  Flipping the tiny
catch reveals a lock of hair tied with a thick thread.  The hair looks to be
made of precious metals itself, but it is very soft to the touch and radiates a
comforting feeling, gold and silver catching the light and shining brightly.  
A feeling of sadness and loss infuses the locket, and if it had any identifying
marks they were rubbed away by the constant feeling of hands against the metal.
It is undoubtedly valuable in more ways than one.  An inscription runs around
the edge of the amulet.    ~
extradesc: inscription
It reads,
"My thought will be for you
My love will be in you
You are the one to love me
So I will live forever"~
