This wicked-looking axe is a massive single-headed axe forged from some kind of
blackened steel.  The head has several jagged protrusions, like the spines on a
dragon's back.  The blade is slightly curved outward, but also has several
sharp jagged angles cut along its edge.  It is attached to a pure black wooden
haft, dark as the night.~
