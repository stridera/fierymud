If the scales on this set of scalemail look familiar, perhaps it is because a
master crafstman painstakingly craft each one to resemble one of the scales of
the great black dragon, Sagece.  The scales must have been gathered during a
successful (meaning only several deaths to the party) assault upon her.  Or
perhaps the beauty of the piece of armor just provides motivation for creative
daydreaming.~

perfect for sneaking while armored.  In addition, they are very light, which
keeps them from impeding movement.  A pair of boots like this would be a

sticking in knots.  A limp pinkish tongue droops out of its mouth between rows
of vicious-looking teeth, forming a puddle of horrid-smelling drool beneath it.~

Once golden-haired with a beautiful, rich brown mane, this lion's head is now
severed from its body, clotted blood matting the edges of its hair.  A terrible
expression of wrath and anguish is locked onto its face, hinting at its
agonizing downfall.  Much of the insides of the head have long fallen out,
leaving a hideously gross interior large enough to fit another head in.    ~
