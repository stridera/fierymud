   The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is
both too bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.

This shiny silver ring is slender enough for a woman to wear,
but not excessively feminine in shape. It is set all around with
amethyst cabuchons, unfaceted and round-faced, set into silver
edgings that are raised slightly to show off the purple jewels.

This ring is very beautiful.  The diamond is a rare blue color, accented by the

the ring, though barely enough to notice.  It looks like it was made for a
lady's hand...  A very wealthy lady's hand.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a

This brooch is made of a mysterious white metal.  The very strange thing about
it is that it is on fire but it is not consumed or melted.  The dark monks must
have taken it from a powerful pyromancer at one time and have stored it ever
since.

   It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.

     This warm, large garment is tailored entirely from feathers.  Upon closer
examination, the cloak looks to be made up of a long cape and two wings
attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.

The book almost hums with power. You approach it reverently, ready to see
the face of some god in its pages, but then... Then... You feel its sheer
evil resonating. This is no ordinary book. And it is nothing holy.~

out. The liquid itself is clear and seems to bubble and sway all by
