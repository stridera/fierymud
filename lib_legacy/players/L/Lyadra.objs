This ring was forged from the power of the Undead.  Feeling somewhat like the
undead as you wear the ring, you become slower in your movements, slightly
enraged, and you feel yourself slipping into the ethereal realm....~

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes are

strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form interesting
geometric designs.  This necklace is a charm from the Wizardess Thekra; you

This vest-like garment is something between a typical doublet and a corset,
ideal as the bodice for a formal gown or the vest of a fancy suit.  The heavy
brocade fabric provides a stiffness and stability a more traditional doublet
lacks without the boning of a full corset.  A loose rose motif typical of
Soltan work is woven in with lustrous threads.  It is trimmed with small pearl
bangles around the bottom and top edges, accentuated with golden fasteners.  
Truly a masterwork garment!~

slightly curved and much thinner than average steel, undoubtedly created by
some uncomprehensible elven miracle.~

Brocade is a very uncommon material for shoes because of how dirty they can
get.  That makes shoes like these extraordinarily rare.  This pair of slippers
is fine brocade stitched over leather for both comfort and support.  The loose
woven pattern of a Soltan rose is accentuated with golden embroidery and
gemstone beads.  A lavish buckle decorates the face of the shoe.  A small
sensible heel adds just that extra touch of height and composure while still
being possible to walk and dance in.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

At first glance, these lenses don't seem to have much of a purpose.  A
prismatic chitinous stick hangs off one side like the handle on opera glasses
or a masquerade mask, yet the lenses still have arms to hold them in place
above the ears like spectacles The glass is of uneven thickness and shape, not
conforming to any specific geometry.  Only by holding them up to your eyes and
looking through them can you begin to see the subtle refraction of magical
energies the lenses detect.~

These fine elbow-length velvet brocade gloves are woven with golden thread in
the loose rose pattern, iconic of finery from Solta.  Small beryl gems and
pearls are sewn on with small gold settings, adding both weight and beauty.  
They're soft and supple, and lustrous in every way.  They are the perfect gift
for a star of the stage.~

This bracelet is actually several very thin golden rings bound together with
gold wire.  It is decorated with fine rose motifs etched into the bands then
embellished with fine yellow citrines and carnelians native to the region
around Solta.  Reflected light glimmers in all directions like a star twinkling
in the night sky.~

Hanging long and billowing, these masterfully woven sleeves ride on the breeze
like clouds on the waves.  A loose pattern of roses typical of Soltan design is
woven into the richly colored fabric.  Gold embroidered trim makes the perfect
final touch to this rich garment.~

It's a large emerald, about the size of a bean.  It glows with a brilliant
green light, illuminating the area around it.  It is undoubtedly enchanted,
since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~

As best as you can tell, this instrument is a harp of some kind.  It is
C-shaped, like the stave of a bow, with the wide mouth of the arc completely
open.  The bottom of the arc is a fat, wide base, anchoring 16 strings which
run from base to midsection of the harp.  It is lacquered black, capped on each
end with gold, and highly decorated with cords which help tighten and tune the
strings.~

extradesc: feather wing-feather-cavern-hawk cavern-hawk-wing-feather immense-feather quill pen
This is the primary flight feather of the giant cavern hawks near the
Stormchild's keep.  Dark gold in color, it is nearly three feet long.  If
someone were large enough, they could probably use it as a quill pen, but other
than that it would make a nice trophy.~
