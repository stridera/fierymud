extradesc: jewelled-eye fist-sized-gem multiple-facets
This is no natural gem!  It's the eye of a Hiver Queen, detached from its
socket.  The many eye facets that once gazed upon the world with ambitious lust
still gleam faintly in death.~

The stone of the ring is a dull brown in colour.  However, you sense an aura of
power around it.  ~

extradesc: bat-tooth-necklace sharp teeth
When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~
