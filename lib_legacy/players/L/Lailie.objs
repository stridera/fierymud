This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

You watch in amazement as flickering tongues of flame race up and down

red in color; the handle of the dagger itself, however, is surprisingly cool.

You are holding a piece of a legendary mineral known as Thawkinixa. Its
existence was thought to be non-existence, at least until now. As you watch
the colors pulsate thoughout the rock, your soul fills with greed. For
many years this mineral was thought to be mythical, but now you hold the
only known piece. Think of what it must be worth!

This is but a handful of small, pea-sized berries.  They gleam with the bright
pink of freshly-burnished, pure copper, and give off an obvious glow of their
own.  Their magical properties are well known, though their source is shrouded
in mystery.  To be certain, they have never shown any inclination to grow in
the soils of Caelia.

white feather has a single dark blue dot near its tip, giving
the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to

a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.

These finely ground lenses must be gnomish work, for they seem to be flawless.

the tip of each prong, a wicked looking arrow looks sharp enough to rend stone.
