Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.    ~

Garlic is said to be able to ward off vampires.  It certainly will ward off
your friends if you eat too much of it, as it can cause very bad breath.  It
is, however, excellent at curing minor illnesses such as the common cold.  ~

it can be quite hot.    ~

with spears before.  Yet it would be extremely deadly in hands trained to use
it properly.~
