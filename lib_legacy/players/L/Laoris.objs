Salt is one of the oldest and simplest spices known to man.  In some ancient
lands, soldiers were paid in salt.  It is used to preserve meat and usually
makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,
just sitting around.  It is the most common spice.

There's something about an open-fire grill that brings out both the worst and
the best in cooks.  Luckily, this steak looks like it encountered the latter,
for it is tender, medium-rare, and perfectly seared on both sides.

     Yech!  Though the birds within the aviary's walls are far from
domesticated - much less housebroken - happening upon such a nasty bit of
droppings is an unpleasant surprise; generally the aviary grounds crew seem to
do a pretty good job keeping the paths clean, turning such offal into the soil
to act as fertilizer for the exotic plant life.
     The core of the droppings is a greenish-grey snakelike solid, surrounded
by an off-white liquid that is quickly drying in the sun.  Though bird
droppings do not have the disgusting smell of other animal feces, they are
still rather repulsive nonetheless.

It has a tough outer skin, but feels slightly squishy around the center
portion.  On both ends of the fruit are browned nubs.  One end looks as if it
has been broken off a branch or stem.  The fruit has a curious smell, quite
strong and sweet.

illithid eggs, few will gather the courage to consume them.

blue.  A silvery light seems to glow about the doll, highlighting its
glittering indigo eyes.  Amusement shows in the capricious grin stitched on its
face.  A tiny glass shard is clasped in the doll's right hand, pyramidal in
shape and about as long as the doll's forearm.

The plushie doll looks just like the great Overlord himself!  Althought cute
and cuddly, the plushie seems to have an air of authority about it.  It even
seems to question 'Done yet?  ' at its imaginary underlings...  Or perhaps
that's your imagination?

The brownie looks positively scrumptious!  Its edges are just perfectly
crisped, and the inside is just moist enough.  The chocolate scent
emanating from the brownie fills your senses... blocking out all other
stimuli... you must... eat... the brownie...

This Draconium catalogues the species of dragons represented in the
Duclian senate at the time of writing, the 11th Day of the Month of
Revolution, 14 MIE.  It magically updates itself, listing only the
species of dragons surviving.
 
The dragons are separated into three major groups based on alignment,
and each of these further divided into two groups each, the true dragons
and the supplementals.  For the first three sections, each page
describes one species of dragon, listing their alignment, type, average
length, breath weapon, any unique spells or skills they might exhibit,
whether they have the ability to shapeshift, and their relative strength
index.
 
The relative strength index is a device the Duclian Organizational Force
uses to rank species' relative powers.  It is only an average estimate.
These lesser races of the Creator are estimated to rank between zero and
ten, but no higher.
 
The final section of this catalogue details the powers and effects of
breath weapons, special skills, and draconian-specific spells.  The
appendicies also contains a page that will magically renew itself,
always reading the names of the current leaders of each draconian
faction.  At the time of this writing, the great 27 Senator Dragons are
listed.

  Kind and magnanimous, silver dragons enjoy helping those weaker
  than themselves.  Silvers can often be found amongst the company
  of humans and elves.  Flying is a true pleasure to silvers,
  reflected by their preference of lofty mountain peaks for homes.

  Bronze dragons are partial to deep water, enjoying aquatic food
  and company.  They are adept swimmers, able to travel nearly as
  fast underwater as airborne.  Justice is important to bronze
  dragons, who do not tolerate cruelty or anarchy at all.

  Oddly, brass dragons are the most social of all dragons, even
  though they typically choose deserts to inhabit.  Some brass
  dragons will confine visitors only to keep them around longer to
  talk.  Sunlight and dry heat are especially pleasing to them.

  Copper dragons have well-deserved reputations as pranksters,
  jokers, and riddlers, often staying out of the reach of opponents
  while shouting insults and abuses.  They are the most selfish and
  greedy of the good dragons.  Coppers often lair in dry mountain or
  hill caves.

  Iron dragons' personalities usually match their steely hides,
  making them appear cold and unresponsive.  Nevertheless, they are
  strong-willed warriors of righteousness who never give up.  Their
  lairs are usually deep subterranean caves or abandoned mines.

  Even more inflexible and relentless than their iron dragon cousins,
  steel dragons follow rigorous schedules and procedures, making
  excellent soldiers.  For their size, they are quite powerful,
  reflected by continual static crackling about their bodies.  Most
  steel-blue dragons lair in mountain caves.

  Perhaps the most beautiful of all, amethyst dragons are also wiser

  Sapphire dragons are very territorial, quickly attacking intruders
  on their stomping grounds without asking questions first.  This
  trait is aided by their ability to fly extremely fast and their
  superior hearing.  They typically live deep underground in
  self-constructed burrows.

  Paranoid about the safety of their treasure, emerald dragons have
  multiple traps and alarms about their lair, which are often in
  dormant volcanoes.  As such, they are extremely heat resistant,
  and often shrug off a fireball as a gnat.

  Mercury dragons have shiny hides, flowing liquid mercury making up
  their entire bodies.  They can harden or liquify at will, changing
  shape to anything, though they maintain their shiny appearance.

  Green dragons are foul-tempered creatures, living in forests and
  regularly enslaving any woodland races in their territory with
  cruelty.  Usually solitary, green dragons, are nevertheless very
  protective of their young, fighting to the death for their safety.
  Cunning and crafty, green dragons concoct elaborate schemes to
  ruin their opponents, rather than attacking overtly.

  Like the other chromatic dragons, blue dragons are extremely

  The smallest and least intelligent of the chromatic dragons, white

  Zombie-like and passive, shadow dragons rely entirely on instinct.
  With no higher intelligence, they are common targets for liches
  and psionics bent on world domination.  They are well-designed for
  combat, for whatever instinct they have seems to make them agile
  and vicious combatants.  Shadow dragons have the ability to turn
  themselves into massless shadows, immune from physical attacks.

  Believed by some to be a bastard breed between black and silver
  dragons, in truth silver-black dragons are a rare species all
  their own.  They are fierce and extremely intelligent fighters,
  always anxious to inflate their pride.  They are not indigenous
  to Caelia, and have been known to attack Nymrill and Dheduu.

Date: May 08 2010

From: Siah

I realize my last letter was bland and lame, so ignore it, or don't read it@0.
What I meant to say was:

Oh Mighty Laoris,

It is with great humility that I summon the will to approach thee, but also it is with great hope.
Indeed, as I have travelled this world under thy powerful gaze, I have become acquianted with the
powerful art of magic. It has surged through me, and has caused the swift and sudden destruction
of my enemies. I have grown in a such a way that this frail body which thou hast allowed me to
keep has become a conduit through obliteration may flow.

For this, thou hast gained my ever lasting gratitude, yet, it is not enough. I desire more.
Canst thou find it in thy heart to grant unto a portion more of thy power? Wilst thou allow
me to continue in the paths of thy might? I have heard of that Sorcerers who have gained
favor in thine eyes have been given the blessing of Meteorswarm.

Know this
if thou wouldst grant unto me this chance to peform tasks for thee, that I might
gain this thing, it would be unto thee I would look as my enemies were crushed before me,
and as I left their empty lifless shells smoldering on the battlefield. It would be with great
and due dilligence I would sweep my enemies down with swift indignation in thy name.

As Metamorpho will,

Siah

This letter is written in dried blood on some sort of semi-transparent parc@0hment.
The deep crimson words appear eerily suspended in the air.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Darkness.

The Silence.

The Stillness.

Death.

It thrives where all else withers.



Life is so difficult to sustain. Eternally consuming, nagging contantly
at the skirt of the nature it claims to worship.
And yet,
Beneath it's very feet, it hides it's inescapable fate.

All that lives must die. All generation is but an inevitable DEGENERATION.

But check them first to make sure I didn't make a mistake with them.  None of these are used at the moment, and most of them are junk...I have them saved on my computer though.

i like the feel of the spells.. and it looks like
the fire damage to my zo@0mbie was reasonable. did
you lower that? the damage done by the tank on fire
is given credit for any of the fire damage. did you
mean to force the necro to group the zombie? it would
be much more convienient and encouraging to use zombies
if they werent draining exp.

From: Mosiah

We the Guardians of Truth ask the powers that be to bestow upon us many pow@0ers of the magical 
realm, the power to GATHER our forces more readily, that truth might be protected.  while it is known 
that truth is best learned when brought to LIGHT and is VISIBLE for all the SEE we desire the power to 
know truth visible and invisible and to see before it is brought to light if it so pleased the gods that they 
might change our eyes from just bringing light to seeing without any what so ever, we as that we have 
your blessing in this matter. that we might better defend truth we would that our ARMOR  be 
strengthen 6 fold and that we not faint upon the field of battle we would that our health come unto us  
4 times what it does now. It is known that the best guardians are those that one would be afraid to face 
we ask that our damage be improved by 2 as should our aim be also and that we might be known about 
the land may our size be that of the stories of old that of large giants 

in summary I ask that you would grant unto us word of recall, detect invisibility, that our eyes instead  of 
being perma lights give ultravison and give us 2 damage roll(giving the item a total of 3) 2 hit roll 6 
armor class 4 hitregen and  2 size  

p.s. thank you for allowing me to change the clan item I am confident that you have seen the change in
got members which is not fully because of this and I am sure that they will say that it isn't but I think it 
might have something to do with discussing the item with them that got many of them playing again

i know you are bussy with quests and all but if you would just mudmail me and let me know that you got this and your thoughts 
thank you mosiah

Hey Laoris,

I think I may be the one who's mail you ate lol? I don't kno@0w for sure however.
No worries. I had previously been given a quest by Tanle for a Ring of Pride. The quest was
to find all fountains and signposts in the game. I had compiled a pretty good sized list and was told I was just about complete.
back in 2007. I emailed Tanle to ask if I can still complete this quest and haven't received a response, assuming that he's gone completely
inactive from the game. I was wondering if I do complete the quest if you are able to award it for me? I appreciate your help.

Thanks,

ruk

Dearest Laoris,
 
This is a reminder about the Snobol's IOU.  I had it li@0ke 4 years ago.
I think it was on my character Pahoran when it was taken.  I original stole it (me being Nehor).  Thanks.

It's a plain-looking black knapsack.  But it harbors a dark secret: there's

oh man..  about my quest seem like i'm going to kill 2 mobs in doom (fire s@0prite + earth elemental)..  that's fine.. i would need a partner to do that..
the problem is "rock demon"..  that's so hard for a solo noob mage..
nowday, i have only 1 char.. others of my char (dimentio's alt) belonged to ehlissa and i couldn't access them.. *sniff*
could u please change to something else?

best regards.
nuto
p.s. for a noob mage.. only standing to watch the rock demon death is hard enough.. i remember that before the rock demon death.. he would do something hurt to everyone in the room..

i have an item idea i would like to quest for
as soon as i get things clea@0red up with fasq, and
get banish done with. tell me what you think:

a transparent silk veil:
+4 height
+50 perception
-5 PAR
-5 BRE
-5 SPE
detect align
detect magic
would of course be worn on the face.
i was told there was some rule about 2 perma-effects
but it seems to not be the case with other quest items
like the mowhawk that have much more influencial stuff.
let me know what you think of it

I just remembered i had never recieved my set of evil
chars from my remort@0 quest. i've now earned 3
and have 1 (faegern). i have 7 **'s and 
8-9 more on the way. do you think i could
just have vitkus (merc) made troll? I just
got him to what i consider the most powerful
a merc can be as a dwarf. i'd like to give him
a bit more. not sure if a race change is equal
value to 2 lvl 1 evils. you can decide how you'd
think it most fair.
thanks :)
flike
ps.. the planar binding cant be used to mem while worn.
can that be fixed? or should i just keep packing
my old book?

Hey Lao,
Tanle put me on a Ring of Pride quest years ago, I went innactive@0 during it. Before going innactive I had almost completed it
and he said that I was very close. I just emailed him a few days ago and he emailed me back today and said I could still finish the quest.
He said that once I finish it that I would need to contact another Imm to have the ring made though and that they could contact him if needed.
My only concern is with the mud being so innactive lately I just want to make sure somebody will be able to do it? Would you be able/willing to make me
my Ring of Pride if I complete the quest and approve that I did complete the quest. The quest he gave me was to find every sign/signpost and fountain room name
in the game. 
Thank You!

white puffy ball that hangs from the end of the stocking and
glittering letters that read : Jolly Fat Bastard.

Greetings M'Lord
I hate to keep bothering you like this.  But we are almos@0t done.
I have finished the quest of Word of Command, having acquired 15 books,
and a pair of spectacles.
Now I will need my spell, and a quest for the Resurrect Spell.
That should do it for me...
However, now that Sorak has the relocate spell, (thanks to you), she
requires a quest for the Meteor Swarm spell. :)
Thank you for your attention to these matters.
with all due respect from all of us,
Korah

Hey,  It's nice hearing from you.  I've been great, married 6 years this mo@0nth.
My son is 5 now and it's been longer than that since I contributed to Fiery.
Chinok has been kind to keep it running.

This action figure appears to be an exact replica of Dakhod!  With a peg leg
and a hook for a hand, the attention to detail is stunning.  This action figure
comes complete with karate chop action when its legs are squeezed, and a
pullstring on his back.
