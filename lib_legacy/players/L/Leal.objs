The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over
time, the color was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light
brown. It's a simple two-piece conical sort of hood, coming to
a point well above the wearer's crown and falling back. A lively
tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.

This is no ordinary cape -- it's that special kind used in
swordplay. A fabric handle is sewn into its center, making
it obvious that you hold it there. Those swirling folds of
black and white satin would easily confound an opponent,
allowing you to seize their weapon in the satin.

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.

The torch is simple in its design. It's made up of a piece of wood with
some cloth wrapped around the top of it, and smells like it has been
dipped in oil.
