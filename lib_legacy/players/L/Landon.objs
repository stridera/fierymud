This crown seems pretty heavy.  It's made of thick gold, and probably

A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several of them in
various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak, which would be
centered over the wearer's forehead.~

This is a quite heavy broad-bladed sword.  The handle is wrapped in a bit of
old rug, with softened leather wrapping around it holding it down.  The nob
looks like an upside down crown, capping the end and holding the tapestry
securely.~
