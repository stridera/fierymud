Salt is one of the oldest and simplest spices known to man.  In some ancient
lands, soldiers were paid in salt.  It is used to preserve meat and usually
makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,
just sitting around.  It is the most common spice.

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!

      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)

They are finely tailored of regular coarse linen and dyed black.

Aww, it's a cute little wing feather from a song sparrow.  It looks delicate,

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks

     (Hint : you need something to write on...then
      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)

This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light
is so bright as to hurt the eyes, yet it is only a bit warm to the touch.  
Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead
of glass.
