   Shaped in this glass is the face of a raging bear.  The mere sight of it's
terrible eyes are disturbing.  It seems so real! It hums with the power of the
awful bear trapped inside it, barely contained.  You wonder if it's even safe

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

The leather straps at the top and bottom of each plate are much longer than
they should be, allowing each to be wrapped around the entire leg once, then
tightened and tied off.  Such an armor style is very unique and actually
functions fairly well as armor, as well as being a reflection of the simplicity
of monastic life.

The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time itself --
that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater than any the world has
ever known, true love and blackest hatred, friendship and betrayal..  All
couched in the language of ancient times to form a manual of behavior for
magicians in the aftermath of a war the likes of which may never be seen
again...  Though the majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out
or damaged, enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.
~
extradesc: cover
The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.
~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.
~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.
~
extradesc: page3
This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small
caption near the bottom of the page reads "NAU I S". That is all you
can tell for sure.

This beautiful cloak is made of some kind of silky white fabric sewn all over
with the most amazing white feathers.  Each full, white feather has a single
dark blue dot near its tip, giving the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it
turns from white to dappled.  The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body,
with a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at the waist.

Date: Mar 08 2022
  To: Lanik
From: Chinok

hello Lanik;
Your quest for Krisenna's horns will not be easy.

I will n@0eed something that you
get from Krisenna.  I will be checking to be sure that
you obtained this legitimately; you must get it yourself
for it to count.
In addition, to prove that you are a hunter of demons
and not in leage with them, please track down and slay
13 HUNTER mobs and an Astral Demon.
Lastly, in order to blind the demon, so his horns can be 
removed, I need a fist-sized ruby.

-
goodluck
Chinok.

This odd little draconian scale is burning with some sort of internal fire,
making it quite warm but bearable to the touch.  It seems to impart some of its
fieryness into its holder, promising power and strength to its wearer.

extradesc: goggles pair mining mining-goggles
This is a pair of fine goggles, made of expertly tanned leather and lenses of
thick glass.  Excellent for protecting the eyes from the loose dust and
occasional hazards in a mine, they would probably also be useful outdoors in a
sandstorm, though underwater use would probably ruin the leather and is not
recommended.

Examining the bracelet closer, you see images of fierce boars somehow printed
on it. You're now quite sure how, or even what exact material the
bracelet is made of, though you suspect some kind of magically treated boar
skin.

extradesc: pliable tough strips leather monastic scriptures fistwraps master
The most powerful weapon a monk master can ever use is his fists, and these
wrappings prove that.  Meditation chants and order scriptures are written all
over these strips which can be laced around the hands, protecting them like
gloves and focusing all of a monk's energy into their strikes.  Written on one
strap is a dedication to the original bearer.

extradesc: tough thick strips leather armwraps master
Armwraps like these would make for poor armor in any other situation, but in
the hands of a truly dedicated monk, they function as a focus for internal
strength and power.  The natural abilities of one such person come to the
forefront, increasing their defensive and offensive capabilities.

Marked with only the symbol of a monk's order, this wristguard is very tough
and hard, prepared to stand up to extreme use in a fight.  A gift like this is
never given lightly, and is only given to those who have proven they know when
to attack, and when to withdraw.

The necklace's main pendant is carved in the shape of a tree.  The tree appears
to be growing...  Can this be?  You notice at the bottom of the necklace that
you can see the trees' rings...  You count 50.  On the side of the tree there
appears to be an inscription.
