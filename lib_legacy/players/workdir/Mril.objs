extradesc: mythril angelic saintly chestguard
Hugely stylized celestial runes have been engraved into this gorgeous
chestguard.  Each rune relates to the domains of the original owner's deity,
putting the priest into further contact with their gods' power.  Made of the
purest mythril, this plate holds the strongest holy enchantments, designed not
to make the wearer the warforce of the gods, but to be their voice and spirit
among mortal man.

can hold great spiritual power and divine favor.  Each set of vambraces like
these is made for a specific cleric in the name of a specific deity, both of

Stormlord, Holder of Tempests, himself. The dark indigo cloth the 
cloak is made of scintillates, giving the impression of thousands of 
tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into its brocade surface. It's quite
heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held together by a bronze clasp,
beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon whose raised fists
make the clasp circular in form. The ankle-length cloak is lined in black
silk and edged in crimson. Your blood stirs inside you as you look at it,
