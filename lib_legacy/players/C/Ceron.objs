Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.~

You look at the messy green gunk in the crystal potion.  You wonder who would
want to keep something like this.~

The orb is totally weightless and possesses a very bright glow.  Gazing into
its crystalline depths, there seems to be insubstantial forms floating within
it.  Before you can decide what lies within, you are forced to look away, lest
its light blinds you.~

This is the legendary Stormshield, once used by the Lords of Mystwatch.  
Resembling a large heater shield, there is a heraldic design emblazoned upon
it.  It is said that this shield was forged by the Gods themselves in the
beginning of the world.~

against damage.  Each scale is embossed along its edges.~

You see a braided suede leather belt here. It's twice the length of your 
entire body. You've seen this type of belt before-- you're supposed to 
take it and wind it around your body twice, loop it in a specific way, 
and let the ends fall to your calves. It seems like it'd hamper your 
movement, if you did that, but perhaps it will benefit you to the point 
that you don't mind it doing that.~

The mallet is made entirely of metal. The black surface of the mallet
seems too soak up your light. The weapon itself is heavy and, although
slightly unwieldly in combat, would make an effective crushing weapon.~
