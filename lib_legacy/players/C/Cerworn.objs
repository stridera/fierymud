9th day of the Month of Discovery, 352

   If your reading this, well, the plans didn't go off correctly.  I wanted a
legacy to carry on.  This tower was to be it.  In my days, I saw many places,
full of traps and treachery, but also of wealth and other spoils.  I strived to
leave such a place myself.  Alas, I plan on destroying these notes when it is
done, thus if you are reading this, the tower is not.  As I write this, the
enchanted tower has been completed ; a grand four stories tall.  It's too bad I
will be destroying part of it soon.  . .
 
  Work will not be finished for months, I fear, and with my ailing health, I
may not live to see it done.  I've called upon many favors - I'm afraid even my
soul will be the cost in the end.  So far, there's not much loot in here, most
has been sold for the protectors of the castle.  Sweet irony.    

   In the end, I have turned to demons to protect the lair, and slave labor to
build it.  What have I become.  Perhaps this is what is truly killing me.  Tis
only luck that the blue dragon has made the tower his perch.  What would it
cost for such a guardian?    

The writing continues in part2, part3, part4, part5, part6, part7~
extradesc: part2
   First, I ask myself, why am I building this tower?  I have adventured for
many years, and have always been fascinated by places I had gone, both in the
architecture, and the secrets held within.  I have decided to leave a legacy
behind me.  Someone has to die for a tomb to be looted.    

   Alas, with a life of adventure came a life with no heirs, so my money is
worthless after I die anyhow.  I am still in good health now, but getting older
every day.  Thus, my life's goal.    

   I have enlisted a few of my more mystical friends for the construction.  
This shall be no ordinary tower, by any means.  For one, we have concocted an
enchantment for the stone of the tower, such that it shall rebuild itself if
e'er it gets destroyed.  The bits of stone are attacted to one another, such
that no matter the distance, they will slowly be pulled together again.  Yea,
it may take millenia if they are far apart, but the tower shall never be
destroyed.    ~
extradesc: part3
   This was quite costly, but I believe it will be a good investment in the
long run.  No matter what happens, the tower will never quite die.    
 
   The basement has been created.  We decided upon an infinite hallway to
protect my study.  It too wasn't terribly hard to create, merely a modified
dimension door spell.  I had to give up my grandmother's broach, though, to get
the work done.  My friends are quite stingy, they are.    

   Finding workers from an area far enough away that they won't be able to find
their way back was quite tough.  The southern continent was a good choice.  To
get back without help, they'd have to raft the blue fog sea.  I've ne'er seen a
bigger ship down there in my days.  Getting them back there will be tougher.  
Our ride got called off to tend to her father, dying of old age. ~
extradesc: part4
   Had the druid community not severed ties with me after the unfortunate
incident in the forest...  I hadn't honestly meant to hurt anything, especially
not the animals, and how was I to know that the owl was a shapechanger...  
Life would be much easier. 

   We just had a few incidents in the construction.  The sub basement floor
collapsed.  It turns out a giant worm has burrowed under the tower.  It turns
out to have some intelligence, I think.  I... agreed to keep it fed if it
did no damage.  I didn't realize how much it eats.  We may need to exterminate
it.    

   Some fool put a door on the second floor of the tower to the outside.  
Unfortunately, they're nothing outside of it.  I've locked it to avoid any more
accidents.  Two deaths were bad enough.  Perhaps they would have survived, but
evidently the door happened to lead right above where the worm had burrowed,
thus the pit was quite deep.    ~

   Part of our labor force has decided to abandon the project.  A few of
them...  Were threatening to break their vow.  I had to put them down.  I think
the rest will understand the graveness of the situation, and will realize the
penalties for betraying me.    

   The work force has mutinied.  After hearing tales of what I did to those
that left, they snuck out after I offered them a two day break.  I will track
them down one by one and punish them all.  Traitors.  First, though, I must
find a replacement work force...  Work most continue - the tower must be
completed I have taken ill as of late, quite severely.  I hope it will pass,
but I must press on in case it does not.  I am ...  Seeking connections at the
moment.    

   I have sought an audience with the Demon Lord Krisenna.  We have struck a
deal; he seems quite benevolent at the moment.  Hopefully it will stay that
way.  The deal works in both our favors.  They provide the workers and
protection, and I provide them with a safe entry way into our world.  They have
finished the external tower, and have retreated into the bowels to finish up.~

   I have allowed them free reign to create themselves a sealed off passageway
to keep anyone who might make their way in from getting to them.  I am not even
allowed to see what they are doing there, lest I bother them, or give others
knowledge of how to do the same thing.    ~

   I have just stumbled back across this book, and it weighs heavily on my
mind.  I have seen my soul blacken over time.  Alas, I think it is too late for
me.  They have taken almost all of my goods as tribute, and they have an iron
grip on the tower.  I plot, hoping to find a way to get rid of them, but I fear
the deal is done.~

      My dear Hrathis,

      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days

   The cover of the book is formed from a solid chunk of bark, with the spine
made somewhat flexible by soaking it in some liquid and gently bending it into
shape.  Each page seems to have once been a leaf from a local tree, torn into a
roughly rectangular shape.  The writing is done in some kind of charcoal or ash
- because of this, the contrast makes some of the words hard to decipher.  On
the whole, the book is in fairly good shape, and is still readable.    

The headings in the book are PAGE1 PAGE2 . . .  PAGE8~
extradesc: page1
Well, I must do something to keep myself from going mad.  I figure I shall 
write my thoughts, as I have an eternity to postulate about things. Why,  
you may ask, do I have an eternity?  Settle in, the story is quite long.

Years ago, I was king of a prosperous kingdom in a land you've probably 
never heard of.  We farmed our land quite efficiently, and there were no
major problems in the kingdom for years at a time.  Then,  I had a son,
Errious, brought to me by my lovely wife.  He was a strong young lad, and 
quite fit to take over the throne after I passed on.  

He loved to travel, and over time mapped out parts of the land outside our 
borders, where noone in our family had likely set foot on for generations.  
In the process, he met a lovely elven woman by the name of Norina. He made 
sure to stop by her home as often as he could in his journies, often for 
just a day at a time, while relaxing after exploring. 

The text continues on PAGE2~
extradesc: PAGE2
Now, around the time that Errious was to return, I fell ill, and was bedridden
for several weeks with a delierious fever. In the meantime, my wife took over
rule of the kingdom, which was the norm when I was unavailable.  When my fever
finally broke, I was disheartened to find out that my son had not yet returned. 

My wife had sent one of our finest horsemen to the area where we knew he had 
headed. Several days later, we found his head, and a note.  It seems that our 
neighbors didn't like our latest visits.  In the meantime, my wife had rallied 
our knights, and had sent them to attack our newfound enemies. 

In hindsight, it was a hasty decision.  It was a fairly even match, but because
of that, the war raged on.  With our proximity, they managed to destroy our
crops, and we in turn, immolated theirs.  Both sides were suffering greatly,
and no real progress was being made in either's favor. 

The story continues on PAGE3~
extradesc: PAGE3
Finally, after several weeks of battle, both sides spirit had been broken, and
we sent a courier to ask for a diplomatic meeting between their leader, Izaro,
and myself.  By this point, his kingdom too was greatly suffering, and he
agreed.  We agreed to meet.    
 
In the meeting we discussed the war- after saying somethings that shouldn't be
said, it turned out that Errious had been seeing Norina, who was Izaro's
daughter.  Alas, Norina was married to a prince from a nearby kingdom, who was
helping his father put down a peasant revolt during the 'visits'.    

One day, he had returned to find Norina and Errious.  He claimed that Errious
had killed Norina, and he defended himself.  I know that cannot be true- I
raised him better than that.  More likely they were both killed in a fit of
jealousy.  In either case Norina and Errious both died that day, and both our
people demanded blood.    

The drama unfolds on PAGE4~
extradesc: PAGE4
We sent our men away, and agreed secretly to a dual to end it all.  Both our 
sides had lost too much, and the fighting needed to end now.  We chose to meet 
far away from the kingdom, and take turns leading farther into the forest, far 
away from any help one's kingdom could give.  It was to be a truely one on one 
battle. 

We eventually reached an area of dense forest with a clearing, and mutually 
decided it would be the setting of the battle.  I could tell by his ways that 
he was a spellcaster, and he could tell by my sword that I wasn't.  As the 
battle begun, I immediately rushed him, and kept him dazed enough to keep him 
from casting. 

And so the battle went.  He was a quick man, and kept from taking too many 
blows, but I was wearing him down.  But then, he managed to sprint out of my 
range, and got off one spell.  I never believed in my life that one spell could 
end my life, but as he finished his incantation, I looked up and saw a large 
ball of light, heading for me.

The end is on PAGE5~
extradesc: PAGE5
The large ball of light turned out to be a burning rock, and it was quite 
enormous. Before I could react, it crushed me.  One spell, and I was dead.  I 
suppose my soul wanted vengeance.  I couldn't just die, and thus I'm here now.
Somehow, he managed to capture me in this. . . room.  For some reason I can't 
escape. 

So I sit, and think, and write.  I know not what happened to Izaro- he could 
not have made it very far, as wounded as he was.  The forest was still full of 
dangerous beasts, and the smell of blood was sure to attract more. But I 
cannot help but feel he wasn't destroyed, otherwise why would my soul be 
trapped here?

Someday, I will destroy him, and in doing so, hopefully be free to finally 
venture into the afterlife.  Until then, I write. Someday, someone may find 
this, and I hope it will teach them something.  War is stupid. If only I would 
have realized the consequences so long ago, maybe things would not be as they 
are. ~

In my time here, I have learned much about nature.  I've learned to make
fire from basically nothing.  I've learned to use the remnants of that fire to
write this book.  I've learned that with the right point of view, nature is a
powerful entity.  

As such, I write the following such that you might glimpse just a touch of 
the powers of nature that I have learned in my many years here. May nature be 
there for you whenever you need her.

Beneath the signature is a series of runes that are rather indecipherable, 
especially in their current condition.  It would be amazing if whatever he 
imbued this book with still worked.    ~

9th day of the Month of Discovery, 352

   If your reading this, well, the plans didn't go off correctly.  I wanted a
legacy to carry on.  This tower was to be it.  In my days, I saw many places,
full of traps and treachery, but also of wealth and other spoils.  I strived to
leave such a place myself.  Alas, I plan on destroying these notes when it is
done, thus if you are reading this, the tower is not.  As I write this, the
enchanted tower has been completed ; a grand four stories tall.  It's too bad I
will be destroying part of it soon.  . .
 
  Work will not be finished for months, I fear, and with my ailing health, I
may not live to see it done.  I've called upon many favors - I'm afraid even my
soul will be the cost in the end.  So far, there's not much loot in here, most
has been sold for the protectors of the castle.  Sweet irony.    

   In the end, I have turned to demons to protect the lair, and slave labor to
build it.  What have I become.  Perhaps this is what is truly killing me.  Tis
only luck that the blue dragon has made the tower his perch.  What would it
cost for such a guardian?    

The writing continues in part2, part3, part4, part5, part6, part7~
extradesc: part2
   First, I ask myself, why am I building this tower?  I have adventured for
many years, and have always been fascinated by places I had gone, both in the
architecture, and the secrets held within.  I have decided to leave a legacy
behind me.  Someone has to die for a tomb to be looted.    

   Alas, with a life of adventure came a life with no heirs, so my money is
worthless after I die anyhow.  I am still in good health now, but getting older
every day.  Thus, my life's goal.    

   I have enlisted a few of my more mystical friends for the construction.  
This shall be no ordinary tower, by any means.  For one, we have concocted an
enchantment for the stone of the tower, such that it shall rebuild itself if
e'er it gets destroyed.  The bits of stone are attacted to one another, such
that no matter the distance, they will slowly be pulled together again.  Yea,
it may take millenia if they are far apart, but the tower shall never be
destroyed.    ~
extradesc: part3
   This was quite costly, but I believe it will be a good investment in the
long run.  No matter what happens, the tower will never quite die.    
 
   The basement has been created.  We decided upon an infinite hallway to
protect my study.  It too wasn't terribly hard to create, merely a modified
dimension door spell.  I had to give up my grandmother's broach, though, to get
the work done.  My friends are quite stingy, they are.    

   Finding workers from an area far enough away that they won't be able to find
their way back was quite tough.  The southern continent was a good choice.  To
get back without help, they'd have to raft the blue fog sea.  I've ne'er seen a
bigger ship down there in my days.  Getting them back there will be tougher.  
Our ride got called off to tend to her father, dying of old age. ~
extradesc: part4
   Had the druid community not severed ties with me after the unfortunate
incident in the forest...  I hadn't honestly meant to hurt anything, especially
not the animals, and how was I to know that the owl was a shapechanger...  
Life would be much easier. 

   We just had a few incidents in the construction.  The sub basement floor
collapsed.  It turns out a giant worm has burrowed under the tower.  It turns
out to have some intelligence, I think.  I... agreed to keep it fed if it
did no damage.  I didn't realize how much it eats.  We may need to exterminate
it.    

   Some fool put a door on the second floor of the tower to the outside.  
Unfortunately, they're nothing outside of it.  I've locked it to avoid any more
accidents.  Two deaths were bad enough.  Perhaps they would have survived, but
evidently the door happened to lead right above where the worm had burrowed,
thus the pit was quite deep.    ~
extradesc: part5
   Part of our labor force has decided to abandon the project.  A few of
them...  Were threatening to break their vow.  I had to put them down.  I think
the rest will understand the graveness of the situation, and will realize the
penalties for betraying me.    

   The work force has mutinied.  After hearing tales of what I did to those
that left, they snuck out after I offered them a two day break.  I will track
them down one by one and punish them all.  Traitors.  First, though, I must
find a replacement work force...  Work most continue - the tower must be
completed I have taken ill as of late, quite severely.  I hope it will pass,
but I must press on in case it does not.  I am ...  Seeking connections at the
moment.    

   I have sought an audience with the Demon Lord Krisenna.  We have struck a
deal; he seems quite benevolent at the moment.  Hopefully it will stay that
way.  The deal works in both our favors.  They provide the workers and
protection, and I provide them with a safe entry way into our world.  They have
finished the external tower, and have retreated into the bowels to finish up.~
extradesc: part6
   I have allowed them free reign to create themselves a sealed off passageway
to keep anyone who might make their way in from getting to them.  I am not even
allowed to see what they are doing there, lest I bother them, or give others
knowledge of how to do the same thing.    ~
extradesc: part7
   I have just stumbled back across this book, and it weighs heavily on my
mind.  I have seen my soul blacken over time.  Alas, I think it is too late for
me.  They have taken almost all of my goods as tribute, and they have an iron
grip on the tower.  I plot, hoping to find a way to get rid of them, but I fear
the deal is done.~

The book is large and heavy, and is sealed with red wax.  Large, golden words

making you realise that this must be a book of power.  One of its stories tells
of a visit from a band of powerful sorcerers who were impressed with Neris'
kindness and presented her with a holy scarab that has some power to it.  The
leader of the sorcerers is shown speaking aloud to Neris refering to her as
"Neris'Kaan", or "Neris the Kind".~

The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time itself --
that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater than any the world has
ever known, true love and blackest hatred, friendship and betrayal..  All
couched in the language of ancient times to form a manual of behavior for
magicians in the aftermath of a war the likes of which may never be seen
again...  Though the majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out
or damaged, enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.~

The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.~
extradesc: page3
This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to

what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small

can tell for sure.~

   The cover of the book is formed from a solid chunk of bark, with the spine
made somewhat flexible by soaking it in some liquid and gently bending it into
shape.  Each page seems to have once been a leaf from a local tree, torn into a
roughly rectangular shape.  The writing is done in some kind of charcoal or ash
- because of this, the contrast makes some of the words hard to decipher.  On
the whole, the book is in fairly good shape, and is still readable.    

The headings in the book are PAGE1 PAGE2 . . .  PAGE8~
extradesc: page1
Well, I must do something to keep myself from going mad.  I figure I shall 
write my thoughts, as I have an eternity to postulate about things. Why,  
you may ask, do I have an eternity?  Settle in, the story is quite long.

Years ago, I was king of a prosperous kingdom in a land you've probably 
never heard of.  We farmed our land quite efficiently, and there were no
major problems in the kingdom for years at a time.  Then,  I had a son,
Errious, brought to me by my lovely wife.  He was a strong young lad, and 
quite fit to take over the throne after I passed on.  

He loved to travel, and over time mapped out parts of the land outside our 
borders, where noone in our family had likely set foot on for generations.  
In the process, he met a lovely elven woman by the name of Norina. He made 
sure to stop by her home as often as he could in his journies, often for 
just a day at a time, while relaxing after exploring. 

The text continues on PAGE2~
extradesc: PAGE2
Now, around the time that Errious was to return, I fell ill, and was bedridden
for several weeks with a delierious fever. In the meantime, my wife took over
rule of the kingdom, which was the norm when I was unavailable.  When my fever
finally broke, I was disheartened to find out that my son had not yet returned. 

My wife had sent one of our finest horsemen to the area where we knew he had 
headed. Several days later, we found his head, and a note.  It seems that our 
neighbors didn't like our latest visits.  In the meantime, my wife had rallied 
our knights, and had sent them to attack our newfound enemies. 

In hindsight, it was a hasty decision.  It was a fairly even match, but because
of that, the war raged on.  With our proximity, they managed to destroy our
crops, and we in turn, immolated theirs.  Both sides were suffering greatly,
and no real progress was being made in either's favor. 

The story continues on PAGE3~
extradesc: PAGE3
Finally, after several weeks of battle, both sides spirit had been broken, and
we sent a courier to ask for a diplomatic meeting between their leader, Izaro,
and myself.  By this point, his kingdom too was greatly suffering, and he
agreed.  We agreed to meet.    
 
In the meeting we discussed the war- after saying somethings that shouldn't be
said, it turned out that Errious had been seeing Norina, who was Izaro's
daughter.  Alas, Norina was married to a prince from a nearby kingdom, who was
helping his father put down a peasant revolt during the 'visits'.    

One day, he had returned to find Norina and Errious.  He claimed that Errious
had killed Norina, and he defended himself.  I know that cannot be true- I
raised him better than that.  More likely they were both killed in a fit of
jealousy.  In either case Norina and Errious both died that day, and both our
people demanded blood.    

The drama unfolds on PAGE4~
extradesc: PAGE4
We sent our men away, and agreed secretly to a dual to end it all.  Both our 
sides had lost too much, and the fighting needed to end now.  We chose to meet 
far away from the kingdom, and take turns leading farther into the forest, far 
away from any help one's kingdom could give.  It was to be a truely one on one 
battle. 

We eventually reached an area of dense forest with a clearing, and mutually 
decided it would be the setting of the battle.  I could tell by his ways that 
he was a spellcaster, and he could tell by my sword that I wasn't.  As the 
battle begun, I immediately rushed him, and kept him dazed enough to keep him 
from casting. 

And so the battle went.  He was a quick man, and kept from taking too many 
blows, but I was wearing him down.  But then, he managed to sprint out of my 
range, and got off one spell.  I never believed in my life that one spell could 
end my life, but as he finished his incantation, I looked up and saw a large 
ball of light, heading for me.

The end is on PAGE5~
extradesc: PAGE5
The large ball of light turned out to be a burning rock, and it was quite 
enormous. Before I could react, it crushed me.  One spell, and I was dead.  I 
suppose my soul wanted vengeance.  I couldn't just die, and thus I'm here now.
Somehow, he managed to capture me in this. . . room.  For some reason I can't 
escape. 

So I sit, and think, and write.  I know not what happened to Izaro- he could 
not have made it very far, as wounded as he was.  The forest was still full of 
dangerous beasts, and the smell of blood was sure to attract more. But I 
cannot help but feel he wasn't destroyed, otherwise why would my soul be 
trapped here?

Someday, I will destroy him, and in doing so, hopefully be free to finally 
venture into the afterlife.  Until then, I write. Someday, someone may find 
this, and I hope it will teach them something.  War is stupid. If only I would 
have realized the consequences so long ago, maybe things would not be as they 
are. ~

This page consists of a number of sketches of what seems to be the same thing 
from different angles.  It appears to be a suit of armor with some sort of 
wings attached to the back of it. The wings are connected with some elaborate 
pulley system to the arms, giving the look of a bird which tangled itself up
in a net.

The caption reads 'Para-assault System'. ~

In my time here, I have learned much about nature.  I've learned to make
fire from basically nothing.  I've learned to use the remnants of that fire to
write this book.  I've learned that with the right point of view, nature is a
powerful entity.  

As such, I write the following such that you might glimpse just a touch of 
the powers of nature that I have learned in my many years here. May nature be 
there for you whenever you need her.  

King Thelmor 

Beneath the signature is a series of runes that are rather indecipherable, 
especially in their current condition.  It would be amazing if whatever he 
imbued this book with still worked.    ~

The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time itself --
that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater than any the world has
ever known, true love and blackest hatred, friendship and betrayal..  All
couched in the language of ancient times to form a manual of behavior for
magicians in the aftermath of a war the likes of which may never be seen
again...  Though the majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out
or damaged, enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.~
extradesc: cover
The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.~
extradesc: page3
This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small
caption near the bottom of the page reads "NAU I S". That is all you
can tell for sure.~

The worn out leather book binding is almost falling apart.  It is very old
and the leather is well oiled from being handed by unclean hands.  The pages in

For all that are powerful
Bringing fists down on the weak
Smashing their souls
And breaking the meek

May they soon meet their maker
Brought forth for their misdeed
Wrought down into the ground
Stomped flat their greed

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence

The glowing pages glow with power, telling a story older than time itself --
that of gods and mortals, struggles with beasts greater than any the world has
ever known, true love and blackest hatred, friendship and betrayal..  All
couched in the language of ancient times to form a manual of behavior for
magicians in the aftermath of a war the likes of which may never be seen
again...  Though the majority of the ancient book's thick pages seem torn out
or damaged, enough of it remains for you to see that it must be very valuable.
The cover looks like a good place to start learning about this book.~
extradesc: cover
The cover of the book reads:

                      THE ENCHIRIDION:

                       BEING A MANUAL 
             FOR THE RECOVERY OF MAGISH VITALITY

You open the book, and see page1.~
extradesc: page1
Hear the words of one who speaks across time: the Gypsy Seeress
Mressnerah:

      My dear Hrathis,

      Long ago, my master told these things to me, and now 
      that I am old, I wish to pass them down to you. When
      you have come into your full power, you will understand
      why I demanded certain things of you.

      Long ago, magicians walked this world with impunity. 
      There was nothing we could not do. I remember those days
      very well indeed. The Cardinal of Templace himself was
      amazed at our bravery, for we could face the Riftwar
      beasts alone, with only our magicks to protect us.

The book continues on page2.~
extradesc: page2
The second page continues:

      But the wizard-dragon Sagece, that foul beast from the
      Demon Planes, despised our kind and put her entire energies
      to work to destroy our control over the human worlds.

      This she did, all too well. I was old even when I felt the
      shockwave of whatever spell she cast that was to spell our
      doom. I looked down at my body and saw the rejuvenation I
      had depended on for beauty disappear, the strength I'd 
      always felt dissipate like fog before the morning light.
      From then on, I was helpless physically; only when I had
      the protection of much stronger folk could I work my most
      devastating magicks.

      But behold, Hrathis. There is way to reverse this evil
      enchantment.

The page ends. The next page is page3.~
extradesc: page3
This page seems very washed out. In fact, it's almost impossible to
make out any details of what was once printed here. All you can see is
what appears to be a blueprint of some kind of large machine. The small
caption near the bottom of the page reads "NAU I S". That is all you
can tell for sure.~

extradesc: bowl raven's-holy-prayer-bowl ravens-holy-prayer-bowl abandoned-bowl-inlaid-silver questobject
A bowl made of a blackened metal inlaid with silver sits here.  Inside it are
smudge marks that smell faint but sweet, probably from incense.  The silver
forms intricate knotwork shapes, some tarnished but others bright.  At the
bottom is the symbol of a raven with wings outstretched outlined in silver with
feathers and talons marked with thinner lines than the rest of the inlay.~

The book almost hums with power.  You approach it reverently, ready to see the
face of some god in its pages, but then...  Then...  You feel its sheer evil
nature and realize this is not a text to praise a god, but entrap one!~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

This staff was made from the limb of a Silveroak tree. Perhaps the Druid
who originally owned this powerful staff received it as a gift from the
tree, for it is inconceivable that anyone would harm a Silveroak by
cutting off a limb. The staff retains the tree's bark and shimmers brightly
in the light.~

extradesc: mace mace-disruption-mace mace-unspeakable-power
This relatively simple mace is almost completely unadorned.  It is perfectly
smooth simple steel on well-varnished wood, lacking almost any distinctive
characteristics.  It radiates no magic, which is often the case of artifacts of
supreme power.  A single inscription is written around the base of the mace
head, where it attaches to the haft.~
extradesc: inscription
The inscription reads: "I am the phoenix who guides the souls to the
Netherworld when they go forth.  " It is clear this mace serves one purpose and
one purpose only: to send the souls of the unquiet dead back to their eternal
rest.~
