This is the ring of a god, granted to one who has shown great courage and
fortitude in retrieving items of certain value.  The Lord Tanle has, however
reserved the right to call on the wearer of this ring if and when it suits his

Only three inches long, this blue and white pin follows a trisecting path

A series of playful dolphins chase each other around the perimeter of the
sea-blue ring.  It is difficult to determine exactly what the ring is made of
-- clear, yet neither crystal nor glass.~

extradesc: shard-red-dragonscale dragon-scale
Merely a chip off a much larger dragonscale, this shard seems to have retained
much of the resilience of its previous owner.  Faint ridges run across the
shard's red surface, swirling and squiggling almost into recognizable images.
The shard of dragonscale is very warm to the touch, apparently maintaining some
of the heat from the dragon it once protected.  A tiny clip is attached to the
back of the shard, allowing it to be fastened to a cloak or tunic.  A small
dragon claw is etched into the clip.~
extradesc: claw etching clip
The dragon claw etching on the clip is minute, half the width of a pinky
finger, but its detail is exquisite, with every scale on the claw painfully
chiseled into the metal.  The claw has a burning blue color, its glow somehow
drawing you in...~

The leather is pale grey, very supple, and thin.  The silver trim is painted on
in long, quick strokes.  No symbols or drawings adorn the spine or cover; only
faint wrinkles criscross the leather.~
