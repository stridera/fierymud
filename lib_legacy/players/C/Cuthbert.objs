These work boots are made of dark brown leather.  They go about calf-high, and
though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled along its
edges.  They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable for anybody
wanting some basic protection.~

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many

mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~
