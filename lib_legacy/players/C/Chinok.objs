i'm going to write this as well as adding a bug repthe batons are hitting m@0ore often then they should i have
two theorys
first both the new trigger you told me about as well as the old code are running and so even if one triggers a cone the other still attacks or cones aswell
or my other theory is that the new trigger attacks and does a cone of cold attack instead of either or. in 10 rounds of combat with a blured ranger
i should get 8 attacks per round i was getting 10-12 per round.
goodluck ramah~

 I will need something that you get from Krisenna. I will be checking to be@0 sure 
that you obtained this legitimately; you must get it yourself for it to count.
In addition, to prove that you are a hunter of demons and not in leage with them, 
please track down and slay 13 HUNTER mobs and an Astral Demon.
Lastly, to cut the horns from the head of the demon, you will need a rune sword.
Complete this quest and the horns are yours! ~

extradesc: wreath christmas-wreath large-green-wreath
Constructed from a large bough of an evergreen tree, twisted back upon itself
into a large circle, this wreath smells with the wondrous winter scent of
Christmas.  Various pine cones and berries are tied into the wreath, and a
large red bow on one side adds a vibrant splash of color to the decoration.  
The hole in the center is fairly wide, probably large enough to fit over your
head...~

Your hand aches to wield this fabulous sword. Made of pure white steel, 
glowing as if from some inner light, it pulses like the heart of legend 
itself. This is the sword of the ancient heroes out of your land's 
stories, the sword that destroyed armies almost of its own accord. This 
is the sword of the god Lokari. It's lavishly decorated: an ivy-leaf 
pattern along the blade. The quillons are short, but curved upward in a 
continuation of that pattern, making a very effective looking basket 
hilt. A huge onyx forms the pommel. You can detect in this amazing sword 
that touch of greatness that has made its name revered -- and feared -- 
by all great warriors.~

The sword is rather small to be called a sword, but it's definitely bigger than
a dagger.  It's rather simple in design.~
