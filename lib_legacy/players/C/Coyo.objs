This ball of light is the most mysterious and magical things you have ever
seen.  The ball is very bright but yet dark at the same time.  The light shifts
from top to bottom and from side to side with small flares from time to time.
This is a miniature replication of the sun at midnight on some parts of the
earth.  Some great conjurer must have made this and given it to some great
person as a prize.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

From: Laoris

Hi Coyo,

Were you holding some keys in your inventory that didn't get sa@0ved?
I couldn't find a few of the required items in your blobbags.

Found 1 wax, missing 1.  Got:
    a wax bubble of royal jelly

Found 4 ropes, missing 1.  Got:
    a coil of rope
    a coil of thick rope
    a brown rope belt
    some frayed rope

Found 8 dragon body parts, missing 3.  Got:
    a severed dragon's head
    a white dragon scale
    a dragon's eye amulet
    a white dragon egg
    a white dragon egg
    a dragon skin
    a yeti's club
    a bone helm

I got the +hp items, 1 beeswax, 1 sticky, sapphire ring, black
pepper, fist-sized ruby, Cloak of Insanity, and garlic.  I haven't
seen the six non-horse mountable creatures either, but I noted
the horses on your trophy.

Are you missing something or am I?  Let me know :)

The doll is a horrid looking thing: it's little, greenish, and looks like the
blob.  Under the globs of gelatinous gleaming gunk, glint the green eyes of a
gooey effigy.  Its original visage is difficult to make out, because of all the
green gelatin caked on it.  The goo is quite sticky, causing anything touching
it to become lodged in the mess.~

protect the holder against most spells, the whole book can protect a town

Hi Coyo,

Suraki told me you are almost done with your quest.  I will wan@0t to
see your riding beasts, so we will either have to work out a time
where you can show them to me, or you may also leave them in a spot
you think is secure, such as the KotF basement.

If you choose to leave them in a location, please mudmail me and let
me know where you have put them.  However, be warned that the mud is
scheduled to reboot at about 8 pm EST on Thursday, May 20.  Also, if
you really want to make sure I get your message sooner rather than
later, you may send me an e-mail at laoris@@fierymud.org.

If you wish to show the beasts to me in person, you may also contact
me in any of the aforementioned ways.

Thanks!
-Lao~

From: Laoris

Coyo, Dwarven Priest:
 
As you know, Dragon's Health is an extremely powe@0rful and difficult spell.  As
such, the test for it will also be extremely difficult. Therefore, we will
require certain aspects of both "dragons" and "health".
 
For dragons, be certain to bring us 11 dragon body parts. Look carefully; many
items which respond to "dragon" are not actually parts of dragons!
 
The "health" is trickier. To begin with, we will need 65 items that give a
positive bonus to your hitpoints. Keep in mind, the higher level armor quest
items should NOT be used for this! Such items will not be accepted - though
feel free to use the lowest level ones.
 
To merge them into one, we require 2 "wax", 1 "beeswax", one "sticky", and 5
"rope" items. I will also need some glue, so be sure to have at least 1.00 each
of 11 different horses.
 
In addition, to bear the burden of strain, you will need to bring 6 mountable
creatures to the fountain - but no horses, as you will surely have obtained
their enmity.
 
Finally, as the spell's usefulness increases with its duration, please bring to
us an item which has the inscription "Tyme shalt only make myne love for thee
stronger." To represent the danger you face, bring an item that "Kings and
queens have sent explorers to their deaths for". For opposition, bring an
object that casts "life drain". To represent the strain of casting, bring an
item that looking at it too long "gives you a headache".
 
Be sure that the spell does not fall into the wrong hands; bring an item that
is said to ward off vampires.
 
Good luck!
Laoris, the Invisible One (and Kourrya, Mistress of Shadows)~

extradesc: pouch cloth
It's just a simple woolen pouch. The fabric is dyed a brilliant
red color, and there's some embroidery on its front. A cord closes
around the pouch's neck; the cord is quite long, long enough for
you to tie its ends around your belt.~
extradesc: embroidery
The embroidery is of a strange kind. Usually embroidery is of
pretty things, for some sort of informative or decorative purpose,
but this picture is of a monstrous golden wolf-like beast with
eerily human eyes.~

The doll is a horrid looking thing: it's little, greenish, and looks like the
blob.  Under the globs of gelatinous gleaming gunk, glint the green eyes of a
gooey effigy.  Its original visage is difficult to make out, because of all the
green gelatin caked on it.  The goo is quite sticky, causing anything touching
it to become lodged in the mess.~

do look effective in helping you traverse the killingly cold snow of the arctic

and there are records of how its power prevented the village of Nordus being
overcome by plagues on several occasions.~

These finely ground lenses must be gnomish work, for they seem to be flawless.
The rims are a thin silver and the nosepiece seems quite comfortable.  They
would surely be a great help to someone who has no near-vision that wants to
read a book or crochet or do anything else that requires them to see things
close up.    ~

This bit of seashell is obviously a piece of a huge shell; you 
can tell by the size of the rills on its other side. The shard,
vaguely conical in shape, fits comfortably in your hand. Now you
just need to figure out where it could have come from.~

An ancient form of weapon similar to a maul, the goremaul is set with tiny
barbs at the head to cause ripping damage along with the usual bludgeon.  Its
handle is silver with a worn, white leather grip and the head of the goremaul
is inlaid with orichalcum, a rare alloy of gold that is said to be especially
effective against evil creatures.  The weapon hums slightly with a not
unpleasant buzz, constantly reminding someone that it is there.  At the base of
the grip is a holy symbol.~
