      you and Frederick. Remember the chants and spells I taught

   Small but solid, this little dagger with its blackened blade seems like it
could do some tragic damage.  A hand-wound leather handle allows a firm grip on
the blade, and being black there would be no shine even during light.

Date: Sep 04 2008
  To: Ceinwen
From: Kourrya

To Ceinwen of the Grove:
The world has become a sad place, far from the gr@0ace of nature that Mielikki in her
wisdom declared for us.  As a ranger, it is your duty to do something about it.
First, I will need you to slay 3 TWISTED, 2 OIL, and 4 SMOKE creatures.  Then, please
retrieve one "sorrow" item from the Twisted Forest.  You will need to retrieve this yourself.  
I will be able to tell if you do not.  Then cleanse all of these with 3 PURE items and one 
POWER item. Bring also the sign of a true ranger, the Cailaran vest.  To prove you know 
the realms, I will want to hear from you the answer to one question:
How many herbs are there, total? Where can they be found?
Finally, bring to me one item that grants the spell which you seek.

Two tiny, golden yellow stalks are suspended in oil inside this vial.  Saffron
is known as the most expensive, hard-to-get spice in the world.  Each saffron
plant, which takes two years to mature, only produces two stalks that can be
used as a spice.  It is a powerful spell component for earth elemental spells,
and it is also a very delicious spice.  Take good care of it.

An elaborate, but feminine, golden crown set with emeralds, this is the crown

These fake roses have a little knob at the bottom that when turned, pulls the

bottom, but don't seem to serve very well for balance, as the doll has trouble
