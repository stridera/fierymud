These pants are full-cut, made from good solid tan leather.  Though hardly
fashionable, at least with the dignified crowd, they're oddly appealing to most
people.  At least they'll afford their wearer's legs with some protection.~

These work boots are made of dark brown leather.  They go about calf-high, and
though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled along its
edges.  They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable for anybody
wanting some basic protection.~
