your friends if you eat too much of it, as it can cause very bad breath.  It
is, however, excellent at curing minor illnesses such as the common cold.

     A slender brown stem supports a wide blossom of tiny seeds, giving the
millet spray the appearance of a cat's tail even down to the fuzzy filaments
growing all about the seeds much like tiny hairs.  Though perhaps the millet
does not look all that appetizing to you, to birds it is a treat on par with
ice cream and other unhealthy sweets.  Many a feathered flier can be seen about
the aviary picking away at the tiny but tasty seeds well into the evening
hours.

Salt is one of the oldest and simplest spices known to man.  In some ancient
lands, soldiers were paid in salt.  It is used to preserve meat and usually
makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,
just sitting around.  It is the most common spice.

     Yech!  Though the birds within the aviary's walls are far from
domesticated - much less housebroken - happening upon such a nasty bit of
droppings is an unpleasant surprise; generally the aviary grounds crew seem to
do a pretty good job keeping the paths clean, turning such offal into the soil
to act as fertilizer for the exotic plant life.
     The core of the droppings is a greenish-grey snakelike solid, surrounded
by an off-white liquid that is quickly drying in the sun.  Though bird
droppings do not have the disgusting smell of other animal feces, they are
still rather repulsive nonetheless.

     Baked apparently from grains harvested within the aviary itself, this loaf
of bread is coarse and rather crude, but certainly looks appetizing to the
empty of stomach.  Breaking the dark brown loaf open, there are quite a few
whole kernels and seeds of grain still intact, and the flour certainly was
barely crushed and sifted.  Perhaps this bread was intended as more of a treat
for the birds above than for human consumption.

Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.

frozen wheat of this roll is unlikely to become any more platable through
thawing--nobody likes a soggy lump of bread.

it takes a particular kind of palate to appreciate it... one that could
