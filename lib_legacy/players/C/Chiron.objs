This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside

These boots are made from hardened leather, dyed black and covered with steel
studs.  Eerily not a creak or a whisper comes from these boots, which makes them
perfect for sneaking while armored.  In addition, they are very light, which
keeps them from impeding movement.  A pair of boots like this would be a
perfect gift for anyone who valued stealth and quickness.

white feather has a single dark blue dot near its tip, giving
the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it turns from white to
dappled. The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body, with
a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at

in its shockingly blue surface. It reflects a fierce strike of lightning
as you look at it. But no lightning flashed right then in the sky....

This 'scrap' of leather is actually a perfect rectangle and has nicely finished

it seems to be reinforced with bands of padding, making it comfortable to wear.
It could easily be tied to the forearm, and would probably blend in well with
the darkness.

Title: The Lost Library of Shiran
Author: Karlix the Omniscient

"...and a great civilization rose and prospered.  They achieved such
wealth and status and they did not want the knowledge they had gathered
and strove for to be lost to succeeding generations.  So they built a great
library on an island off the coast of their great city.  Into this library
they placed all the knowledge they had gathered over the centuries.  Great
tomes about life, mythical creatures, far away and mythical lands, great
items of magic, etc, etc.  Such was the knowledge that they possessed that
it is rumored the gods got jealous and deemed the information kept in that
library too great for mortal minds.  And so, it is rumored it was the
gods who destroyed the Library and with it all the knowledge kept
therein..."

It is hard to discern the edges of this tunic, for they fade and shift from
sight, as if actively avoiding detection.  While apparently made from
black, studded leather, the tunic is lighter than most cloth and can be violently
shaken without making a sound.  Tunics of this kind are often presented to
high-ranking rogue guild members and are not given away lightly.

About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.

extradesc: belt emblazoned baldric
This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders,      
to support a sword's sheath. A lion rampant adorns the front of
it, where it goes across the stomach. The baldric seems very
old; its owner hasn't taken good care of it -- the leather is
cracked in places.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

This slender rapier is long, its blade not sharp but is point wickedly so.
It is made of some very bright alloy of steel that looks almost silvery,
and its hilt is wrapped in blue leather. The crossguard is the traditional
basket hilt, but very ornately done, sweeping and scrolling.

   The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is
both too bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.

of a visit from a band of powerful sorcerers who were impressed with Neris'
kindness and presented her with a holy scarab that has some power to it.  The
leader of the sorcerers is shown speaking aloud to Neris refering to her as
"Neris'Kaan", or "Neris the Kind".

Feather-light silk is artfully sewn into leggings, gathered at the waist and

changing as it is moved and shimmering in the light.  They look like they would
be rather baggy, but comfortable - how not, as they are made of the finest
silk?

An airy-light robe of the finest silk shimmers and shines in the light,
reflecting many colors that change as it is moved.  Every color in the rainbow
is represented here and there, though if the fabric is moved the colors shift
again.  It looks like it is all made of one solid piece of fabric, hemmed only
at the collar and the sleeves.  It looks like it would be loose but comfortable
to wear.

A bowl made of a blackened metal inlaid with silver sits here.  Inside it are
smudge marks that smell faint but sweet, probably from incense.  The silver
forms intricate knotwork shapes, some tarnished but others bright.  At the
bottom is the symbol of a raven with wings outstretched outlined in silver with
feathers and talons marked with thinner lines than the rest of the inlay.
