This hideous face is like a mask, only the eyes and mouth have been sewn shut

without strings.  Much larger than a normal human face, and much more rugged,
this face appears to have been peeled off whole from someone, then prepared to
be worn as some kind of hat.  The face feels moist, as if it was freshly

drawstring at the wait insures that they should fit anyone.  Given their

tiny indigo-colored gems woven right into its brocade surface. It's quite
heavy, with a handspan-wide collar held together by a bronze clasp,
beautifully worked into the shape of a horned demon whose raised fists
make the clasp circular in form. The ankle-length cloak is lined in black
silk and edged in crimson. Your blood stirs inside you as you look at it,

These are not so much slippers as they are actual hollowed out feet, chopped

foot was severed, and has been expertly, if not magically, preserved.  
Stitched together like shoes so as to allow anyone to wear them, the
resemblance to halfling feet is unmistakable regardless.

extradesc: svelte human hands gloves decay
These hands are little more than skin now, having been cleaned and tanned to
make gloves out of.  Necromantic magic makes it clear that these hands, while
seeming fresh, were made to be used on a regular basis.  How horrible that
someone would take another's hands, then rip them apart only to remake them as
handwear!

Disgusting!  Made out of waste and refuse, these slippers are enchanted to
eternally fester and rot.  As disgusting as something like this is, those that
practice necromancy find that their powers are significantly improved when
wearing clothing like this.

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes 
are strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads. Here and there 
little strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form 
interesting geometric designs. This necklace is a charm from the 
Wizardess Thekra; you recognize it at once.

and there are records of how its power prevented the village of Nordus being
overcome by plagues on several occasions.

weapon favored by most clerics.
