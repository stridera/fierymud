This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

extradesc: helm templar
Beautiful detailed wings sweep off the side and to the back of this helmet, as
if carried on a current of air.  Pressed into the top of this platinum helm is
the holy symbol of the paladin for which this helm was made, strengthening the
already powerful bond between the paladin and the powers of honor and justice.

As you look at the large white dragon's egg, you seem to remember something you

what was that.

extradesc: platinum bracer templar
Large enough to cover from the wrist to beyond the elbow, this large bracer is
both stylish and effective.  It covers almost the entire girth of an arm, with
the small exposed section being mostly protected by hinges and buckles to hold
the bracer securely in place.  The holy symbol of the original owner's order is
shown in detailed relief on the face of the bracer.  The original owner's name
is also etched on the inside.

One glance at this weapon is enough to tell you that it has been 
powerfully enchanted. Black runes run the length of the sword, and a 
dull white flame surrounds the blade. The blade itself has an odd purple 
hue.

As pork chops go, this one is on the large side.  It has been delicately
seasoned with garlic, parsely, and black pepper.  It is still warm, and juices
