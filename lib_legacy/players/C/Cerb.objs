A shiny disc of polished steel makes the main part of this piece of armor.
Tooled across its edges with a scrolling design, everything about it, from
the subtle decorations to the fine straps, makes it look expensive and
highly effective. There are only a few little dents in its surface to mar
its mirror-like perfection.

Golden, buttery pastry crust forms a double-handful of some
kind of handheld pie. You smell meat inside it, a little cool
from its earlier baking, but still delicious.

extradesc: scroll rough graphed roughly-graphed
This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.
