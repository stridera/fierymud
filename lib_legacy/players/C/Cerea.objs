Though they are indeed solid black leather, these gloves appear to be covered

the distortion from the smoke is akin to a heatwave passing through the desert.
Although by appearances they should offer little in the way of protection,
these gloves boast the strength and resilience of the demon whose skin they
were made from.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.~

extradesc: gloves dragon hide dragon-hide pair a-pair-of-dragon-hide-gloves venath
Though they are indeed solid brown leather, these gloves appear to be covered
in thick smoke which eminates from the pores of the leathery surface.  The
effect of the distortion from the smoke is akin to a heatwave passing through
the desert.  Although by appearances they should offer little in the way of
protection, these gloves boast the strength and resiliance of the dragon whose
skin they were crafted from.  There appears to be an inscription on the inside
of the right hand glove.~
extradesc: inscription
Emblazoned in the leather on the inside of the cuff reads:
Specially crafted for the legendary assassin Kresselack, may his stiletto's forever haunt his foes.~
