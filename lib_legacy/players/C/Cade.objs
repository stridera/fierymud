When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed
hastily with clumsy hands. The teeth vary in shape and size making you
wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

extradesc: straw hat
Made from many long, slender pieces of straw all braided together,
this hat has a wide brim and a generally rounded crown. It is just
a little floppy, but does an excellent job of keeping the sun out
of one's eyes.

The thin staff is as light as a hollowed out tube, but as strong as any metal
sword picked off the forge.  The green glow radiating from the brown oak gives
the impression that the stick is naturally green.  The glow seems to emanate a
deep wisdom.
