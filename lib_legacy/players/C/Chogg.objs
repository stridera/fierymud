These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

Examining the bracelet closer, you see images of fierce boars somehow printed
on it.  You're now quite sure how, or even what exact material the bracelet is
made of, though you suspect some kind of magically treated boar skin.~

extradesc: black-white-satin-cap
This is no ordinary cape -- it's that special kind used in swordplay.  A fabric
handle is sewn into its center, making it obvious that you hold it there.  
Those swirling folds of black and white satin would easily confound an
opponent, allowing you to seize their weapon in the satin.~

Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather
fearsome to have produced such a magnificient specimen.  The last owner must
not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.~
