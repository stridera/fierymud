This breastplate is somewhat small, likely designed for an elf or slender
human.  It is formed from a strange metal, ice-cold to the touch, yet not
melting in heat.  The plate is much thinner than steel, not even as thick as
most swords.  A series of leather straps on the back may be tied together to
hold the breastplate on.~

Composed of tiny metal links interwoven to form a tight knit but lightweight
skirt of armor, the mail is padded with a thin layer of leather to prevent
chafing.  With some of the links tapered at the end of the skirt, the mail
produces a light whisper-like musical tone with excessive movement such as
combat.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

This beautiful cloak is made of some kind of silky white fabric sewn all over
with the most amazing white feathers.  Each full, white feather has a single
dark blue dot near its tip, giving the cloak a kind of shimmery nature as it
turns from white to dappled.  The cloak fits closely about its wearer's body,
with a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at the waist.~

The fluffy white feather is quite long, with a red shaft. It looks
suspiciously like a writing utensil!

      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)~

Made from a single large shell that must be grown for years, a bracer like this
is given to rangers who have demonstrated their dedication to protecting the
wilderness.  An abalone shell such as the one this is made from would be worth
a fortune on the market, but that value pales in comparison to the magical
enchantments it could contain.~

Small and round, this ear stud is made of an odd white metal and shaped
somewhat like a little sphere.  It feels cool against skin, strangely drawn to
it as if magnetic, allowing it to stick to an ear without a piercing.~

The mask shimmers slightly as you hold it up and you see yourself reflected.  
There seems to be a subtle difference between what you see and how you remember
yourself to appear to others.  Perhaps this is the real you.~

This is the Cailaran Vest, which you've heard of in stories, seen in tapestries
and paintings, even idly imagined seeking (and finding).  It's a long green
vest, belted around the waist with a bronze clasp, and flowing to the calves.
The grass-green silk is lightly embroidered in golden thread in a criss-cross
pattern.  The double-breasted collar is embroidered as well, in golden
four-pointed stars.  It'd look perfect with a silk blouse and breeches.~

Two thin strips of metal, one silver, one gold, twisted gently together form a
simple, elegant bracelet.  Though it bears no signs of unique purpose, it would
make an excellent accessory to just about any outfit.~
