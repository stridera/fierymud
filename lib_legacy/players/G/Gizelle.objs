The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its brightness is nearly
unbearable to look at, but somehow seems to cast a cool glow across the area.~

The main body of this exquisite ring is made of bright silver that seems to
glow aquamarine-blue with an inner light.  The pearl that adorns it is stunning
and larger than usual, with deep blue sapphires running otter-swift around the
main center of attention.  The ring is neither wide nor narrow, making it
wearable by either men or women.~

Smoky quartz is a powerful mystic matrix because it energizes like clear quartz
but also has strong connections to the realms of sleep and dreams.  Mounted in
a silver setting, a pendant like this provides powerful connections to both the
moon and the Reverie, making it highly prized by faeries and witches alike.~

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.~

   The cover of the book is formed from a solid chunk of bark, with the spine
made somewhat flexible by soaking it in some liquid and gently bending it into
shape.  Each page seems to have once been a leaf from a local tree, torn into a
roughly rectangular shape.  The writing is done in some kind of charcoal or ash
- because of this, the contrast makes some of the words hard to decipher.  On
the whole, the book is in fairly good shape, and is still readable.    

The headings in the book are PAGE1 PAGE2 . . .  PAGE8~

Well, I must do something to keep myself from going mad.  I figure I shall 
write my thoughts, as I have an eternity to postulate about things. Why,  
you may ask, do I have an eternity?  Settle in, the story is quite long.

Years ago, I was king of a prosperous kingdom in a land you've probably 
never heard of.  We farmed our land quite efficiently, and there were no
major problems in the kingdom for years at a time.  Then,  I had a son,
Errious, brought to me by my lovely wife.  He was a strong young lad, and 
quite fit to take over the throne after I passed on.  

He loved to travel, and over time mapped out parts of the land outside our 
borders, where noone in our family had likely set foot on for generations.  
In the process, he met a lovely elven woman by the name of Norina. He made 
sure to stop by her home as often as he could in his journies, often for 
just a day at a time, while relaxing after exploring. 

The text continues on PAGE2~
extradesc: PAGE2
Now, around the time that Errious was to return, I fell ill, and was bedridden
for several weeks with a delierious fever. In the meantime, my wife took over
rule of the kingdom, which was the norm when I was unavailable.  When my fever
finally broke, I was disheartened to find out that my son had not yet returned. 

My wife had sent one of our finest horsemen to the area where we knew he had 
headed. Several days later, we found his head, and a note.  It seems that our 
neighbors didn't like our latest visits.  In the meantime, my wife had rallied 
our knights, and had sent them to attack our newfound enemies. 

In hindsight, it was a hasty decision.  It was a fairly even match, but because
of that, the war raged on.  With our proximity, they managed to destroy our
crops, and we in turn, immolated theirs.  Both sides were suffering greatly,
and no real progress was being made in either's favor. 

The story continues on PAGE3~
extradesc: PAGE3
Finally, after several weeks of battle, both sides spirit had been broken, and
we sent a courier to ask for a diplomatic meeting between their leader, Izaro,
and myself.  By this point, his kingdom too was greatly suffering, and he
agreed.  We agreed to meet.    
 
In the meeting we discussed the war- after saying somethings that shouldn't be
said, it turned out that Errious had been seeing Norina, who was Izaro's
daughter.  Alas, Norina was married to a prince from a nearby kingdom, who was
helping his father put down a peasant revolt during the 'visits'.    

One day, he had returned to find Norina and Errious.  He claimed that Errious
had killed Norina, and he defended himself.  I know that cannot be true- I
raised him better than that.  More likely they were both killed in a fit of
jealousy.  In either case Norina and Errious both died that day, and both our
people demanded blood.    

The drama unfolds on PAGE4~
extradesc: PAGE4
We sent our men away, and agreed secretly to a dual to end it all.  Both our 
sides had lost too much, and the fighting needed to end now.  We chose to meet 
far away from the kingdom, and take turns leading farther into the forest, far 
away from any help one's kingdom could give.  It was to be a truely one on one 
battle. 

We eventually reached an area of dense forest with a clearing, and mutually 
decided it would be the setting of the battle.  I could tell by his ways that 
he was a spellcaster, and he could tell by my sword that I wasn't.  As the 
battle begun, I immediately rushed him, and kept him dazed enough to keep him 
from casting. 

And so the battle went.  He was a quick man, and kept from taking too many 
blows, but I was wearing him down.  But then, he managed to sprint out of my 
range, and got off one spell.  I never believed in my life that one spell could 
end my life, but as he finished his incantation, I looked up and saw a large 
ball of light, heading for me.

The end is on PAGE5~
extradesc: PAGE5
The large ball of light turned out to be a burning rock, and it was quite 
enormous. Before I could react, it crushed me.  One spell, and I was dead.  I 
suppose my soul wanted vengeance.  I couldn't just die, and thus I'm here now.
Somehow, he managed to capture me in this. . . room.  For some reason I can't 
escape. 

So I sit, and think, and write.  I know not what happened to Izaro- he could 
not have made it very far, as wounded as he was.  The forest was still full of 
dangerous beasts, and the smell of blood was sure to attract more. But I 
cannot help but feel he wasn't destroyed, otherwise why would my soul be 
trapped here?

Someday, I will destroy him, and in doing so, hopefully be free to finally 
venture into the afterlife.  Until then, I write. Someday, someone may find 
this, and I hope it will teach them something.  War is stupid. If only I would 
have realized the consequences so long ago, maybe things would not be as they 
are. ~

This page consists of a number of sketches of what seems to be the same thing 
from different angles.  It appears to be a suit of armor with some sort of 
wings attached to the back of it. The wings are connected with some elaborate 
pulley system to the arms, giving the look of a bird which tangled itself up
in a net.

The caption reads 'Para-assault System'. ~

In my time here, I have learned much about nature.  I've learned to make
fire from basically nothing.  I've learned to use the remnants of that fire to
write this book.  I've learned that with the right point of view, nature is a
powerful entity.  

As such, I write the following such that you might glimpse just a touch of 
the powers of nature that I have learned in my many years here. May nature be 
there for you whenever you need her.  

King Thelmor 

Beneath the signature is a series of runes that are rather indecipherable, 
especially in their current condition.  It would be amazing if whatever he 
imbued this book with still worked.    ~

For all that are powerful
Bringing fists down on the weak
Smashing their souls
And breaking the meek

May they soon meet their maker
Brought forth for their misdeed
Wrought down into the ground
Stomped flat their greed

For soon the good will arise
And bring evil to its end
Stop our troubled existence 
Then let us to ascend~

   The quaint sounds of spring fill my ears with a joy not found else where.  
The breeze showers my skin with the sensations of the air.  This feeling

  Down into the consciousness 
   Collected in a small form
Then spread out to be recollected

Until they collide with perfection

          What could be
 The greatest thought of them all~

extradesc: trinket leather tattered
   The small scrap of leather has been worn beyond belief.  Its edges are
frayed and it is very soft to the touch.  There is a very small portion of a
picture that is crafted onto it, lending to the certainty that it is from a
larger piece of artwork.  Judging from the condition of the leather, this has
been around a long time, and held regularly as someone's good luck trinket.  ~

small jewel embedded in the base, glowing slightly.  It appears to be a beloved
