These pants are full-cut, made from good solid tan leather.  Though hardly
fashionable, at least with the dignified crowd, they're oddly appealing to most
people.  At least they'll afford their wearer's legs with some protection.~

These work boots are made of dark brown leather.  They go about calf-high, and
though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled along its
edges.  They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable for anybody
wanting some basic protection.~

This weapon is a steel ball mace affixed to a sturdy wooden shaft.  Its surface
is covered with runic embellishments, dedicating this mace to the service of
divinity, though its power is quite diminished.  The symbols indicate a
relationship with the Knights Templar.  Perhaps the Templar Magistrate in
Mielikki will know more.~

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

This is the hind end of a larger piece of bread.  It consists almost entirely
of crust, now hard and stale.  There is nothing particularly wrong with it, but
appetizing it is not.    ~

A bunch of stale bits of bread lie here.  They look as though they could
provide a modicum of sustenance...  To a very hungry person, that is.    ~

These sleeves are flimsy beyond use.  Perhaps the Rogue guild master will know
what to do with them.~

These work boots are made of dark brown leather.  They go about calf-high, and
though they're unornamented, the leather is finely worked and tooled along its
edges.  They have no cuffs, and a very low heel -- quite suitable for anybody
wanting some basic protection.~

The yellow of this flower is so deep and shiny that it's reflected off any
surface brought near.  The stem is still green and unwilted, so it can't have
been picked long ago.    ~
