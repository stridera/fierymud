The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over
time, the color was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light
brown. It's a simple two-piece conical sort of hood, coming to
a point well above the wearer's crown and falling back. A lively
tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.

     This warm, large garment is tailored entirely from feathers.  Upon closer
examination, the cloak looks to be made up of a long cape and two wings
attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.

extradesc: droppings nasty bit bird
     Yech!  Though the birds within the aviary's walls are far from
domesticated - much less housebroken - happening upon such a nasty bit of
droppings is an unpleasant surprise; generally the aviary grounds crew seem to
do a pretty good job keeping the paths clean, turning such offal into the soil
to act as fertilizer for the exotic plant life.
     The core of the droppings is a greenish-grey snakelike solid, surrounded
by an off-white liquid that is quickly drying in the sun.  Though bird
droppings do not have the disgusting smell of other animal feces, they are
still rather repulsive nonetheless.

     A slender brown stem supports a wide blossom of tiny seeds, giving the
millet spray the appearance of a cat's tail even down to the fuzzy filaments
growing all about the seeds much like tiny hairs.  Though perhaps the millet
does not look all that appetizing to you, to birds it is a treat on par with
ice cream and other unhealthy sweets.  Many a feathered flier can be seen about
the aviary picking away at the tiny but tasty seeds well into the evening
hours.

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.

This beautifully curving feather is a deep royal blue, just like the kingfisher
it comes from.  It's a primary flight feather from the left wing, so it would
probably make an excellent writing pen.

     About as big around as your fist, the smooth off-white surface of this egg
is speckled with tiny flecks of blue and yellow, giving it an almost marbled
appearance.  The egg is warm in your hand, and you can almost feel the beating
of a tiny heart inside it.  Perhaps if kept properly warm and cared for, in a
few days the most wonderful of treasures might be discovered inside.

     Someone had to have paid thousands of gold pieces for such a spectacular
piece of artwork - yet this wondrous little figurine came from within an
actual bird's egg!  Accurate down to the smallest detail, this heavy metal
statuette of a cockatiel is encrusted with jewels of all sorts: dark brown
faceted tourmaline stares back as the bird's eyes, small citrines and rubies
create the distinctive orange cheek patches, and smoky quartz and clear
diamonds make up the feathers.

extradesc: chain singing
This is a six-foot length of dull black links.  The dark, sullen metal from
which they were forged reflects little light.  The links are nearly
rectangular, and lie almost flat due to a clever design.  The claw at the end
is rectangular as well, except that its pointed tine juts outward at a small
angle.  The claw is perhaps double the size of a link.  Stains and scratches
abound on this weapon.

This silver bracelet is heavy and solid, with a clasp that unhinges
to get it on and off the wrist. It is chased all 'round in onyx, a
thick black shiny stream of it, so that only the very edges of the
silver backing are visible at its top and bottom edges, encircling it.
