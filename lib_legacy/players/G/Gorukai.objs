Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

a white leather clasp holding it closed at the throat and at

  The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand. It seems to light up
the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

     Baked apparently from grains harvested within the aviary itself, this loaf
of bread is coarse and rather crude, but certainly looks appetizing to the
empty of stomach.  Breaking the dark brown loaf open, there are quite a few
whole kernels and seeds of grain still intact, and the flour certainly was
barely crushed and sifted.  Perhaps this bread was intended as more of a treat
for the birds above than for human consumption.

extradesc: fiery black chaotic gauntlets
Wreathed in ever-burning flames, these gauntlets are horrible things indeed!  
Spiked protrusions cover the back of the hands, and the fingers reach out to
end in demonic, claw-like digits.  Hollow like a shell, but heavy like stone,
these gauntlets could well have been crafted from the carapace of some minor
devil or demon.

extradesc: thin-elven-blade
This blade looks quite similar to a regular longsword, but is much thinner and
the metal seems much stronger.  It is extremely light, and a few test swings
prove it to be a fine, expertly crafted weapon.

extradesc: gloves thick
These gloves seem very thick and would probably protect the wearer from heat.
Most useful for a smith or armourer.  They seem to give off small puffs of
white powder when they are beaten though?    
~

Hmm, the white powder seems to be asbestos.  Lovely.  Course with your
lifestyle I wouldn't think that would be the cause of your demise >;-)

As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.

two large horns, gleaming with a sinister life of their own.  Black flames burn
about the horns, showing their truly Infernal nature.
