extradesc: bat-tooth-necklace sharp teeth
When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

The rough platter of insectoid scales seems to have no distinct color.
Shifting hues move across its surface as light strikes it from different
angles. All colors? Or none? You shake your head in wonder.~
