Disgusting!  Made out of waste and refuse, these slippers are enchanted to
eternally fester and rot.  As disgusting as something like this is, those that
practice necromancy find that their powers are significantly improved when
wearing clothing like this.~

extradesc: fistwraps-master fist-wraps pliable-tough-strips-leather monastic-scriptures
The most powerful weapon a monk master can ever use is his fists, and these
wrappings prove that.  Meditation chants and order scriptures are written all
over these strips which can be laced around the hands, protecting them like
gloves and focusing all of a monk's energy into their strikes.  Written on one
strap is a dedication to the original bearer.~
