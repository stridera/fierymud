You pick up what can only be described as liquid light, gently swirling in a
small pool.  The pool splits into two small droplets of equal size, each alight
with similar incandescence.  Strangely, they do not leave any smears or traces
behind, remaining perfectly coherent.~

This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.  It is
enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside of the ball
cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small sun, radiating
bright light in all directions.  If you have this item, luck, determination and
the Gods are with you.~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.  Made of some
dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit and buckle around a very
large arm, are worked in a cunning scrolling design.  They're obviously very
old, as well; the metal feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with
the same arms have altered their shape slightly.~

Some of the pages seem to be marked, in particular page16 and page37
which talk about future directions for more powerful spellcasters and
how to encode a simple cipher respectively.

The preface briefly states how essential it is for a spellcaster to
protect his spells against accidental or deliberate theft, by encoding
them.~
extradesc: page16
A passage has been circled on this page, it reads:
    ...so in order to ensure that the magic user has a copious supply of
willing subjects for his experiments, he must first ingratiate himself with
his chosen town by generous acts. An intelligent mage will try and get
himself accepted into the council, and perhaps even move for a law which can
be used to aid him. This could state that all mad people be locked up, or
all criminals be killed. We all know how easy it is to turn a mind to madness
and the mage may then take these subjects 'under his protection' and
experiment on them without worry, as the populace soon forget what has
happened to them...

There is also a note in the margin which seems to be a calculation of some
sort and a reference to page23.~
extradesc: page23
Ack, its a recipe for unlimited power, but it involves several unsavoury
ingredients including human organs. A passage has been circled on this page
too, and it reads:
    ...obviously in order to get this many human hearts is impossible
which is why this spell still remains theoretical, although if one were
to perfect some sort of cloning technique, coupled with a spell for creation
of a human, then it might be possible to create a human with many vestigial
organs which would presumably still be valid for the recipe...

Your skin crawls as you continue to read, anyone who really thought this
sort of stuff would work would have to be mad right?~
extradesc: page37
There are some simple ciphers on the page here, and some notes in the margin
which look like the would have continued onto page 38, only that page has
been torn out of the book! You read the notes anyway and puzzle over the
missing data:
    ...and as has been known through history the simplest cipher is a
substitution whereby one letter is substituted for another (for example
the next letter in the alphabet) and the message is rewritten. The decoder
knows that the letters are shifted by a certain number of positions and
can easily decode the message. This is known as a monoalphabetic cipher. A
more complex 'polyalphabetic' cipher such as the Vigenere cipher may also
be used. The illustration on the next page shows this in action, but basically
the implementation is as follows:
     1) the keyword is chosen and repeatedly written below the phrase to be encoded
     2) the combination of keyword letter and phrase letter are used to index  the Vigenere tableau
     3) the indexed letters form the encoded phrase
And the decryption works in reverse, going down the column indexed by the
keyword letter to the encoded letter, and determining which letter heads that
row. Obviously a keyword of all 'a' would not encrypt at all.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.~

This is a quite heavy broad-bladed sword.  The handle is wrapped in a bit of
old rug, with softened leather wrapping around it holding it down.  The nob
looks like an upside down crown, capping the end and holding the tapestry
securely.~

extradesc: dill umbel feathery flower flowers yellow green
   A single stalk of dill, complete with a fist sized umbrel of yellow-green
flowers, grows in a small earthen pot.  Basking in the unnatural glow of the
room has benefitted the plant, which has a strong aroma.  The stalk seems to be
in good condition, nearly ready for harvesting of its oil.    ~

This long, slender brown object could be mistaken for a twig if it didn't smell
so good.  Used to spice up apple cider, cinnamon is a local favorite in many
other dishes as well.  Don't eat too much of it though--in high concentrations,
it can be quite hot.    ~

The red liquid inside the vial is very thick and slowly slides around when
moved.  The glass that it is constructed from shows its age, for it holds many
scratches and chips, but yet is unbroken.  At the point of attachment of the
strap there is a thick piece of leather, pressed with a symbol of a dragon,
which wraps around the cap, sealed with some sort of wax like substance.  
There is some small print on the strap.~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

These leggings are made of a magically hardened ice called ice-steel.  
Ice-steel is as hard as steel and weights as much as ice.  On the thigh of each
leg is an image embossed in a strange red ice.  The image is the symbol of the
cult of Tri-Aszp: a bleeding dragon's claw~

patchy bark of the branch is left natural, the crevices between the patches
exposing the golden wood beneath.  One end comes to a naturally terminating
point; the other is wrapped in light leather and bolted into place.  The wand
is otherwise unadorned.  A small tag is attached to the wand.~

The book almost hums with power.  You approach it reverently, ready to see the
face of some god in its pages, but then...  Then...  You feel its sheer evil
nature and realize this is not a text to praise a god, but entrap one!~

extradesc: winged-cloak pile feathers
This warm, large garment is tailored entirely from feathers.  Upon closer
examination, the cloak looks to be made up of a long cape and two wings
attached to the sides into which you could slip your arms.  Though somewhat
restrictive of your movement, the wings give you a feeling of freedom, almost
as if you could take to the skies and soar amongst the birds themselves.~

This is claw is undeniably sharp as you feel in the palm of your hand.  It is
sharp enough to cut through almost any armor, and you fear the beast that once
had possession of this.  Anyone who does not own the claw fears of it, for it
means a source of protection against foes.~

This staff was made from the limb of a Silveroak tree. Perhaps the Druid
who originally owned this powerful staff received it as a gift from the
tree, for it is inconceivable that anyone would harm a Silveroak by
cutting off a limb. The staff retains the tree's bark and shimmers brightly
in the light.~

The whisk is only as large as a woman's hand, and made of bamboo.  Several
pieces of light bamboo have been woven together at the handle, their ends
allowed to fray to form a whisk.  It's lightweight, and its whorled strands of
bamboo would make it an excellent whisk for the powdered tea of the tea
ceremony of Odaishyozen.~
