extradesc: sun midnight-sun very-dark-bright-ball-light
This ball of light is the most mysterious and magical things you have ever
seen.  The ball is very bright but yet dark at the same time.  The light shifts
from top to bottom and from side to side with small flares from time to time.
This is a miniature replication of the sun at midnight on some parts of the
earth.  Some great conjurer must have made this and given it to some great
person as a prize.~

So light it seems made out of cloud rather than fabric, the silk has been dyed

that the dark blue kimono is only the outermost of three layers - inside it are
a light blue and white kimono.  No wonder it can be used as armor!    ~

The dragonflies are swen on to the silk with a combination of silk and metallic
thread.  Bodies of iridescent green and wings of silver are outlined in a
simple black on the deep blue of the kimono.    ~

extradesc: shield silver-bossed-shield yellow-shield-bossed-silver
The shield is round, with good, sturdy handles on its back for gripping it and
keeping it close to the body for defense.  It is made of steel overlaid on
wood, and the steel is bossed in silver, and shined to a high sheen.  The
design of a lion is etched into the center of the shield, a quick but detailed
job.    ~

This long staff is made of some sort of dark wood that tapers from the top to
the bottom, which is capped in black iron.  Two sections of its length are
wrapped in leather strips, though the rest of it is covered in a regular
arrangement of thick thorns.  The bulbous top of the staff is covered in them.
This weapon, for weapon it must be, has a good weight and heft in the hand.~

upward toward the blade, and the shiny gold of them and the pommel contrasts
with the green fire of the hilt.  It is wrapped in gold wire for a better grip.~

extradesc: eyes ice-eyes two-balls-ice
As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.~

The hood is purple leather, soft as silk, ornamented with golden ribbon around
the edges.  Its lappets hang down the wearer's chest and back, allowing the
hood to fall back.  An attendant air of disaster seems to hang around this
hood, but you must admit, it is very flattering.~

The blue robe of silk has a single, mysterious symbol on its front.  While the
image is familiar, you can not place where you have seen it before.~

A closer look at the symbol reveals the paw print of a panther superimposed
over a balanced scale.~

It is a fine bracelet that looks like it was carved from one large pearl, with
a twisting whorled design inlaid with gold.  It fits over the wrist, sliding on
without a clasp or hinge.  It glows with the lustrous inner light that only the
finest pearls have.~

This is just a plain pair of glasses until worn.  Once placed over the eyes,
they begin to glow with a golden light and transform into a thin line of energy
that hums for a moment and then seemingly vanishes except for a small glyph
representing "Truth" that can be seen deep in the pupils of the wearer.    ~

extradesc: scale perfect-white-dragon-scale
About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.~

This huge two handed longsword is made of a mysterious magical black steel.  
The blade is the sharpest you have ever seen, and with all that weight behind
it, it can be very deadly.  There are still traces of blood on the tip of the
sword from a recent killing.  The hilt has several carvings on it but the
largest one is of a thorn.  Next to the thorn is a small plaque that probably
has the owner's name on it.~
