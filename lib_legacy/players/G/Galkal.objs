marking out an abstract bird symbol on the back which, though it is also in

fabrics.  Long ties at the neck can be used to fasten the cloak against the
chill winds of the north.  It looks like it would also make great camoflauge in

The bracelet is formed from small beads of gold and grayish colored stones.  
It is very old and shows the marks from years of use.  The stone beads are
cracked and worn down on the edges and a few of them have chipped apart.  The
gold beads are starting to tarnish and fade, almost matching the dull luster of
the stone, from prolonged contact with the sweat from the skin.~

Made from many long, slender pieces of straw all braided together, this hat has
a wide brim and a generally rounded crown.  It is just a little floppy, but

If it weren't for its bright red color, this precious splinter would go
unnoticed because of its tiny size.  However, as soon as it is picked up it
begins to emit a magical light.  It has clearly been enchanted.~
