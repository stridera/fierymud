This ring was forged from the power of the Undead.  Feeling somewhat like the
undead as you wear the ring, you become slower in your movements, slightly
enraged, and you feel yourself slipping into the ethereal realm....~

The woman in this painting is amazingly beautiful, but in the same
way that a deadly sword is beautiful. She's exactly like a sword --
whipcord-lithe, slender, well-muscled, and seems as if she is about
to strike. Her eyes seem incredibly intelligent and perceptive. The
portrait is no bigger than the palm of your hand, making the artistry
of the representation seem all the more amazing. 
   The woman in the painting is looking right out at the viewer. As
you watch, her full, lush lips move, and you hear words: "My little
Frederick, remember that I am always watching over you." You hear no
more.~

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes are
strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads.  Here and there little
strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form interesting
geometric designs.  This necklace is a charm from the Wizardess Thekra; you

This vest-like garment is something between a typical doublet and a corset,
ideal as the bodice for a formal gown or the vest of a fancy suit.  The heavy
brocade fabric provides a stiffness and stability a more traditional doublet
lacks without the boning of a full corset.  A loose rose motif typical of
Soltan work is woven in with lustrous threads.  It is trimmed with small pearl
bangles around the bottom and top edges, accentuated with golden fasteners.  
Truly a masterwork garment!~

someone living in the limelight.  A flare at the bottom heightens the movement

Brocade is a very uncommon material for shoes because of how dirty they can
get.  That makes shoes like these extraordinarily rare.  This pair of slippers
is fine brocade stitched over leather for both comfort and support.  The loose
woven pattern of a Soltan rose is accentuated with golden embroidery and
gemstone beads.  A lavish buckle decorates the face of the shoe.  A small
sensible heel adds just that extra touch of height and composure while still
being possible to walk and dance in.~

A massive bag made of thick leather, the outer layer has been ripped and torn
to shreds, obscuring the silvery runes that once covered it.  Bits and pieces
of them can be seen, but never enough to be read.  Whatever was holding on to
this bag probably liked the bag but not the runes.    ~

At first glance, these lenses don't seem to have much of a purpose.  A
prismatic chitinous stick hangs off one side like the handle on opera glasses
or a masquerade mask, yet the lenses still have arms to hold them in place
above the ears like spectacles The glass is of uneven thickness and shape, not
conforming to any specific geometry.  Only by holding them up to your eyes and
looking through them can you begin to see the subtle refraction of magical
energies the lenses detect.~

since it's warm to the touch and gives off a faint sense of well-being to
anyone who picks it up.  Looking closely, the very faint outline of a hawk is
visible on one facet.~

There is an eerie sort of quality to these gloves.  They are a cloudy grey
color which traps the light shone upon them.  The fingers are long and the
gloves appear to have been bent permanently, being most comfortable in the
shape of a solid, firm fist.  The materials from which they were created seems
rather unusual and could well be supernatural judging by the look of them.~

The mandolin is fairly light for its size, made of a thin yet durable walnut
wood and skillfully stained in patterns of six-pointed flowers on the
teardrop-shaped sounding board.  The neck is also stained dark, and the tuning
pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.~

The wood of the recorder glows with the deep purple of a fish-oil finish.  The
sound that issues from it is incredibly sweet and haunting.  It seems to play
itself as your fingers run over its smooth curves.~

You watch in amazement as flickering tongues of flame race up and down this
blade.  The blade of this dagger is hot to the touch and a dull red in color;
the handle of the dagger itself, however, is surprisingly cool.~

This mighty sword was the prized possession of the Lizard King, ruler of the
Great Northern Swamp.  Forged from mythril and enchanted in the depths of the
castle beneath the swamp, the sword was created to bring fire to the darkest of
places and burn all enemies before it.  It is truly a staggering weapon to
behold!~

This little silver charm is the God of the Moonless Night's gift to his
clerics, to keep them safe and identify them as Lokari's to anyone who might
inquire as to their status.  It's just a silver crescent-moon shape.~

The leather is pale grey, very supple, and thin.  The silver trim is painted on
in long, quick strokes.  No symbols or drawings adorn the spine or cover; only
faint wrinkles criscross the leather.~

This is the primary flight feather of the giant cavern hawks near the
Stormchild's keep.  Dark gold in color, it is nearly three feet long.  If
someone were large enough, they could probably use it as a quill pen, but other
than that it would make a nice trophy.~

extradesc: icicle sharp-icicle
A sharp icicle seems to be magically preserved, for it does not melt even when
taken to warm climates.  Thin string wrapped around the thick base acts as a
grip, indicating that it could be used as a weapon.  Whether or not it would be
a very effective weapon, however, is yet to be seen.~
