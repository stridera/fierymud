The fire seems at the same time both large, yet small, hot yet cold.  
Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand.  Its luminosity is both too
bright and too dim, yet seems to light the area perfectly.~

Salt is one of the oldest and simplest spices known to man.  In some ancient
lands, soldiers were paid in salt.  It is used to preserve meat and usually
makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,
just sitting around.  It is the most common spice.    ~

Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.~

These butter-yellow boots look clunky and hard to walk in, but they tingle as
you look at them.  You recognize them as that rarest of items, the Seven League
Boots of legend.  Put them on!  See how much faster you move!~

extradesc: sleeves sorrow sleeves-sorrow woven bark
These sleeves are woven with several kinds of bark: tough bark for protection
against blows, sinewy for strength, and dense burr-like material to slow
punctures.  On top of each forearm is the symbol of the Rhell tree: a large
round flower with milky-white petals.  In addition, a single droplet of fluid
is just falling from the tip of the lowest petal on each flower.    ~

This bone is under a foot long, and clearly comes from the leg of an
unfortunate gnome.  It's highly polished, as if it were extensively handled.  
An inscription, apparently burned into the surface of the bone, starts near the
middle and spirals toward the thick end.  Its language is unknown to you.~

This is a six-foot length of dull black links.  The dark, sullen metal from
which they were forged reflects little light.  The links are nearly
rectangular, and lie almost flat due to a clever design.  The claw at the end
is rectangular as well, except that its pointed tine juts outward at a small
angle.  The claw is perhaps double the size of a link.  Stains and scratches
abound on this weapon.~
