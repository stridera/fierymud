Daedela  (Jun 27 2023) [ 3054]  for a portable hole: 12 items that respond to "bag" (2 are "baggy" the other 10 are "bag").  3 "round" mobs.  1 "eating" mob.  1 "hungry" mob.  2 "devourer" mobs.  2 "scavenger" mobs.  and then any 10 mobs that pick things up (called "scavenger mobs").  There are over 450, so just find any 10
