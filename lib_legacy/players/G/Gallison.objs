This action figure appears to be an exact replica of Dakhod!  With a peg leg
and a hook for a hand, the attention to detail is stunning.  This action figure
comes complete with karate chop action when its legs are squeezed, and a
pullstring on his back.

The coral ring seems totally flawless. It is made of the finest coral
you have ever seen, and fades from a light pink on one side to white
on the other. It is smoothed completely and coated with a clear substance
so that it is not the least bit abrasive.~

Supplying your comrades with armor can be a grueling and thankless task. 
@0Nonetheless, to do it efficiently can take some experience and talent 
1 items of PROTECTION, and 1 item that casts 'armor' on the whole room. 
To complete the training, have 14 mobs on your trophy that appear in groups of three or more. 
One of whom must respond to ARMOR. Only one mob per zone, but they do not need to be 1.00 or anything. 
So if you walked into a room and there were 3 seethers there, that would NOT count, but a mob such as
the Sunken's Elite Lizard Man would. Good luck young cleric.
