It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes

little strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form 
interesting geometric designs. This necklace is a charm from the 
Wizardess Thekra; you recognize it at once.

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably

crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.
