This jewel is the size of your fist! Beneath its multifaced surface you

Vulcera's fiery passion and hot desires.

This robe is made not from cloth or silk or any other known fabric, but is made
from Wyrd Weave, a substance spun from the fabric of magic itself.  Such a robe
is a vast undertaking to make, requiring the most powerful arcane substances
and materials known.  Once created and attuned to a wearer, the robe changes to
match a sorcerer's mood and style, as well as

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

allowing them to grow with their wearer as a caster's magic grows in power.

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

of vicious-looking teeth, forming a puddle of horrid-smelling drool beneath it.

extradesc: pants pale blue icy icy-blue loose icy-blue-pants folded
   These pants are made out of a satiny material that feels soft and smooth,
cold on the outside but comfortable when worn.  Large pockets should have
enough room in them for as many oddments as one could desire, and a thin
drawstring at the wait insures that they should fit anyone.  Given their
shimmering appearance and comfortable fit, it is almost certain they are
magical in nature.

Ok, your quest for Flood will be fairly straightforward:

* Kill 8 WATER @0mobs
* Slay 1 FLASH mob
* Retrieve 28 different liquids in 28 different liquid containers

Good luck!

These tights look like they'd be a perfect fit! A tie-waist secures
them at the waist, and the thick woolen material goes from there all the
way down to your feet. They look quite old, and seem to glow with some
kind of magical power. Perhaps they're enchanted!

It's a fairly simple necklace -- teak beads carved into geometric shapes 
are strung onto dark thread to form a circle of beads. Here and there 
little strings of beads are strung along the main circlet to form 
interesting geometric designs. This necklace is a charm from the 
Wizardess Thekra; you recognize it at once.

extradesc: glass-globe snow-globe snowglobe
As you peer into the globe you can see a courtyard and a tall tower amongst the
snow.  Hang on, little people shapes are MOVING in there.  This is very
disturbing!  When shaken, the snow inside flutters around madly, but the little
people seem unaffected.

extradesc: orb sphere chaos ball
A sphere of pure unlaced darkness.  The casing around it appears to be clear,
letting the the view inside be known.  Black clouds seem to be moving within
the orb, lighting threads around violently.  It is its own world of chaos.
