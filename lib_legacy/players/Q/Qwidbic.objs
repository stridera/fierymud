This bone is under a foot long, and clearly comes from the leg of an
unfortunate gnome.  It's highly polished, as if it were extensively handled.  
An inscription, apparently burned into the surface of the bone, starts near the
middle and spirals toward the thick end.  Its language is unknown to you.

extradesc: cloak fancy woolen once
This cloak was once quite fancy and shaped perfectly.  Now, however, it is torn
and somewhat discolored.  The silvery lining is shredded and has lost its glint
and sparkle.  The owner of such a cloak must have been quite wealthy, and it is
a wonder why such a precious item would go to waste.  It has a lone, long faded
symbol across the back.

This is a six-foot length of dull black links.  The dark, sullen metal from
which they were forged reflects little light.  The links are nearly
rectangular, and lie almost flat due to a clever design.  The claw at the end
is rectangular as well, except that its pointed tine juts outward at a small
angle.  The claw is perhaps double the size of a link.  Stains and scratches
abound on this weapon.

The book is leatherbound, and masterfully made, with thick paper pages. 
Written there, in flowing, well-trained script, you read:

   Day 22, Month of the Winter Wolf
   My men go out today to battle the Frost Elves across the mountains. I do 
   not know how to prepare my troops. Yesterday, Lady Rill sent her Amazons 
   to assist me in Queen Serazais' mad quest, but I do not know if even 
   they will make much difference in this fight. We are outnumbered. That 
   obscene little man Serazais sent me, that outlander necromancer, last 
   night cast a spell he said would protect us, but I don't believe it'll 
   work. Ah!-- I hear the war-trumpets. Pray to whatever gods you pray to 
   that at least some of us will return alive, my dearest Thraja.

This is the last entry in the book. You see no further entries in the 
beautifully crafted journal.

makes you very thirsty if you eat too much of it.  It can be distilled from the
ocean or mined from the mountains.  Some kinds of salt can be found in deserts,

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.

Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.
