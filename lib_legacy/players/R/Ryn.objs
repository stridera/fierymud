The creatures that fashioned these boots let nothing go to waste.  These orange
and yellow boots are very comfortable, you could walk all day in them.  The
thick skin and durable construction, would also offer you a fair degree of
protection in battle.~

These lightweight rations aren't the best-tasting, but they are the traveler's
best food for long trips -- they never spoil, and fill the stomach for many
hours.  There is dried meat of unknown origin here, mixed with nuts.  The whole
mess is glued together into a bar by means of some waxy, fatty substance.    ~

      while carrying both, type: write on paper with quill
      OR you may hold the quill and type: write paper)~
