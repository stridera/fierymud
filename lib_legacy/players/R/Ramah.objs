A broad band of silver, the legendary ring of Krystophus appears quite ordinary
save for a some runic engravings that run the course of the ring.  The ring
itself is rather warm and fills your head with a strange, accelerated sensation
and low humming as you touch it.~

These boots are made from hardened leather, dyed black and covered with steel

perfect for sneaking while armored.  In addition, they are very light, which
keeps them from impeding movement.  A pair of boots like this would be a
perfect gift for anyone who valued stealth and quickness.~

I see Ogawk's player file (Ija has player file too, but it's not been touch@0ed 
in a long time.  I'd say try changing your password, then reset it back to your normal 
password on those characters, and let me know.  It's strange, 
When passwords are encrypted, part of the encryption used is the name, and it's almost like it's using the old name for the password encryption.. if it is, I may need to do some tweeking
thanks for finding that tho.

Hi Ramah,

Figured I'd get my $0.02 in for an item.

I know it's a bit of a cliche, but I am suggesting a cloak of invisibility.  

I see a couple of alternatives for stats for such an item.  Version 1 would
include a degree of hiddenness - something like hide, a fairly good AC, and maybe
a dexterity boost, and be targetted at mid levels - say 40 - 60.

Version 2 would be targetted at higher levels, and include a good AC, some dam roll -
because you can't defend against what you can't see, and intrinsic INVIS.
Perhaps this would be a level 70+ item that may also include some hitroll.

Anyway ... that is my first idea ... and should be tempered with the fact that
I've just finished a bottle of wine :).


Enjoy :)

Marlia

   I'm made the rooms for the trainers, and set up the zone files.  They al@0l
now have lvl 55-60 items found nowhere else in the game.  One is my peice of
rogue armor, calmed down a bit.  The other two i just made.  Calken has a 2h
bludgeoning weapon.  I'm ok with this getting disarmed, because its lower
leveled, so if a person disarmed it at a level worth using it, its well earned.~

Hi Ramah,

Thanks for your mail.  I'm struggling to even remember what I mud mailed you
for my original ideas but I'll have a think and let you know next time I see
you on.

Enjoy.

If you would look at my trophy, you could tell me whether or not I am on the right track.
 In the meantime I am afraid to kill anything else cause I don't want to mess up the trophy list
respectfully,

] hey there Ramah. I'm writing in regards to a posting on the news saying t@0hat
 you can recover 'lost' level 3 armor quest items. I have quite a few misplaced 
armors for the characters I have. I guess I'll just list em off. Mericon: studde
d gauntlet, boots, helm, sleeves. Denon: vambraces. Terhan: fistwraps, slippers,
 bracer. Dagross: gauntlets, greaves, bracer. Grimlon: slippers, skullcap. I'm n
ot sure if these can all be recovered or not, but if they could it'd be great. L
ookin forward to hearing back. Thanks Ramah!~

So i charged 5k p per point except perception which i charged 1k plat for
@0  and 12k plat for the de invis and gave ultra vision in trade for the infa light
  GoT has  87,000 p at this time and the warriior version costs 187,000
  p and the cleric costs 185,000 p i fear i am chargeing tomuch for perc it
  is more then half the cost of the cleric version and 1/4 the cost of the
  warrior
  cleric version cost is 70,000 for stats 100,000 for perc and 3,000 core item cost 12,000 for de invis
  warrior version cost is 120,000 for stats 52,000 for perc, 3,000 core item cost and 12,000 for de invis

   *boggle*.  I thought about killing one of the lowbee-blocking rangers ju@0st
to keep the quest interesting.  The sack of items is the stuff you can take.  
I forgot to put 3 phase helms in there, but you know i have at least 3 and they
all count.  Pretty sure those were the only items i get to keep, so you can
take the rest.~

To the Dark Magic's Keeper:

   I have a petition of the most secret and @0serious nature.  I have mastered
the art of animation and manipulation of the once-living, both bone and flesh.
I wish now to discuss with you the art of dematerializing and rematerializing
such a body.  With such a spell, one could cause a body to move even great
distances, bringing it into existance before my feet, for me to do as I wish.
I have reason to believe that such a spell exists.  Teach me this spell, and I
will searve you to the cold end.

Your Faithful Acolyte,
Fayris Ice-Dealer of Nymrill~

all you ask is possible, without renaming files, or anything special.
ther@0e are commands to do everything you've asked.
which will do the file renaming as you have commented on.

if there's anyting specific you're tyring to do, let me know, and I'll help

Hi Ramah,

Ages ago you were asking for item ideas.

Well it's way late, but I think I have a good one.

A cloak of hiding.  It periodically adds to your concealment level.
So you will eventually become practically invisible if you don't move
or if you have sneak.

I have no idea of the balance, or what other properties it would need
to fit in with things, but thought it was an interesting idea.

Maybe I'll see you around again one day.

Marlia~

Hey man, wanted to let you know that I was pretty peeved earlier this morni@0ng when Strider and Yuhen started slaughtering my characters (or otherwise trolling
 them) because they said the didnt want me killing town guard anymore. 
Pretty sure that there are no rules against doing this since its
Not that easy to do (as evidenced by the dozens of corpses of 
practically ever character of mine that Ive accrued since I started
unning all my players at once, which in and of itself seems like a 
positive (since if peeps see that other peeps are playing whether they know its all one person or not others will likely come back, 
as I have). Additionally, if they or you want to thwart a players 
efforts to kill in town, a think a policy change should be made 
guards strengthened or more are made to pop in one area) rather than their simply meddling and chopping me to pieces. 

Anyway, Id like to be able to continue what Im doing unbothered (again, Ive died many time doing it, and as you know, I dont have resurrect 
yet  so my deaths and the time and effort needed to regain the xp, 
should be seen as consequence enough for my evil ways)... and my 
multiplayer activities should be seen as a good thing.

If you guys want to make what Im doing harder to do, to the point that 
the costs outweigh the benefits, so be it, but to do what they did to me 
this morning (basically threatened and then followed through on a threat 
to kill one of my mortals for every additional guard I killed is, in 
my mind, bad for business IF: you dont want to piss people off and have 
them not play which youd mentioned to me was not a personal goal of 
yours as head administrator of the mud.
yours as head administrator of the mud

anyway, thanks for listening.~

even though I have a character on remort?~

extradesc: tunic-assassin lighter-than-air-studded-tunic
It is hard to discern the edges of this tunic, for they fade and shift from
sight, as if actively avoiding detection.  While apparently made from
black, studded leather, the tunic is lighter than most cloth and can be violently
shaken without making a sound.  Tunics of this kind are often presented to
high-ranking rogue guild members and are not given away lightly.~

The staff has intricate elven runes across its length, telling of histories
long ago past.  Finely chiseled from a heavy dark brown maple wood, it has a
carved handle two-thirds of the way up so it may be held without covering any
of the runes.    ~

   This is no ordinary branch, it feels warm to the touch and you can only
surmise that it has come from one of the druid's fabled holy oaks.    ~
