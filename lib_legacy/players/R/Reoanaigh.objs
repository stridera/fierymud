The book is leatherbound, and masterfully made, with thick paper pages. 
Written there, in flowing, well-trained script, you read:

   Day 22, Month of the Winter Wolf
   My men go out today to battle the Frost Elves across the mountains. I do 
   not know how to prepare my troops. Yesterday, Lady Rill sent her Amazons 
   to assist me in Queen Serazais' mad quest, but I do not know if even 
   they will make much difference in this fight. We are outnumbered. That 
   obscene little man Serazais sent me, that outlander necromancer, last 
   night cast a spell he said would protect us, but I don't believe it'll 
   work. Ah!-- I hear the war-trumpets. Pray to whatever gods you pray to 
   that at least some of us will return alive, my dearest Thraja.

This is the last entry in the book. You see no further entries in the 
beautifully crafted journal. ~

The long wooden oval frames support your feet on interlaced thongs, and strap

do look effective in helping you traverse the killingly cold snow of the arctic

It's an extra-long quill from the back of an Eldorian Porcupine.  Though
extremely painful when jabbed into bare flesh, young punk sorcerers use these
as quills for scribing spells.  Being thinner than a bird feather, they make
impressive, spidery-looking letters but also break more easily.~

As you look at the tapestry, your spirit rises from the sublime colors and
expert weaving of the piece, then falls, as you notice how ragged its edges
are, and how obviously neglected it is.  There's no way it can be repaired, you
see.  That's too bad.  If it were in better shape, it'd be worthy of a lord's
castle.  You might even want to put it in yours, if you ever get one.~
