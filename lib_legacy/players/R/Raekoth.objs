This small ball of light is giving off an immense amount of light.
It is enclosed in some type of a glass orb that seems to keep the outside
of the ball cool to the touch and manageable.  The inside glows like a small
sun, radiating bright light in all directions.  If you have this item,
luck, determination and the Gods are with you.

Sparkling with some mysterious light, these bracers are indeed a work of art to
behold.  Twin snake-like dragons are carved into the sapphire making up each
bracer.  Each serpent has four claws and manes resembling bolts of lightning.
A semicircular white diamond has been placed in each dragon's mouth, looking
somewhat like a twisted crescent.  A tiny black dot appears slightly off-center
in each diamond.  Beneath the sapphire exterior, layers of strong steel stand
between the gemstone and the softer padding beneath.  There must be some sort
of magical protection upon these bracers though, for such beautiful sapphire
would never stand up against physical attack.

A quicksilver mess of barely-defined scales and membranes resolves itself into
a pair of wings upon closer inspection.  They seem to magically resize
themselves if worn, becoming closer to the size of the wearer as though to fit
them personally.  Once worn, they attach themselves seamlessly to the wearer's
back and look like an extra set of limbs that could probably be used for their
original purpose: flight.  Their value seems beyond reckoning.

     Yech!  Though the birds within the aviary's walls are far from
domesticated - much less housebroken - happening upon such a nasty bit of
droppings is an unpleasant surprise; generally the aviary grounds crew seem to
do a pretty good job keeping the paths clean, turning such offal into the soil
to act as fertilizer for the exotic plant life.
     The core of the droppings is a greenish-grey snakelike solid, surrounded
by an off-white liquid that is quickly drying in the sun.  Though bird
droppings do not have the disgusting smell of other animal feces, they are
still rather repulsive nonetheless.

extradesc: feather royal-blue-feather deep-blue-kingfisher-feather
This beautifully curving feather is a deep royal blue, just like the kingfisher
it comes from.  It's a primary flight feather from the left wing, so it would
probably make an excellent writing pen.

Strangely, you are able to pick it up in your hand. It seems to light up
the area, but somehow, seems to shed no light at all.

     The beak of a parrot, this grey hook-shaped bill has razor-sharp edges
honed daily by its former owner.  Though most birds are not aggressive, only
the most foolhardy would not look to its own defense.  It looks as if someone
has drilled two holes in the sides of the beak and run a leather thong through
them so that you could tie the hookbill onto your head; it might also function
well as a kind of dagger in hand.

those blades do a number on someone's arm or fingers, and wouldn't it be
something to see the metal handles protruding from the back of yon adventurer?
Indeed, the shears make for a nasty weapon.
     There is an inscription of some sort along the handle.

and might seem even a bit sissified for the more beastly of occupations.  The
thin material has enough stretch to it that you might even be able to wear the
sleeves about your legs like a pair of tights in a stretch (no pun intended!)

extradesc: ice eyes magical pair two
As you look closer at the pair of eyes, you notice that they glow from the
inside out.  Although they are made out of ice, they are not melting or
exceedingly cold to the touch.  If you held them, they could probably be used
as a light source.
