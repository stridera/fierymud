The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over time, the color
was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light brown.  It's a simple two-piece
conical sort of hood, coming to a point well above the wearer's crown and
falling back.  A lively tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.~

This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders, to support
a sword's sheath.  A lion rampant adorns the front of it, where it goes across
the stomach.  The baldric seems very old; its owner hasn't taken good care of
it -- the leather is cracked in places.~

Quite large for a rabbit's foot, the previous owner must have been rather

not have been very lucky, however, having lost such a vital appendage.  Some
flecks of blood stick in the matted rabbit's hair around the area from which
the leg once protruded.  A thick strand of twine runs through the foot,
allowing it to be worn.~
