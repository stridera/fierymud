When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed

wonder if more than bat teeth were used. Even with all of its flaws,
you can tell the necklace held some significance to the owner.~

The tasseled hood was once made of grey leather, though over
time, the color was obscured into a kind of all-purpose light
brown. It's a simple two-piece conical sort of hood, coming to
a point well above the wearer's crown and falling back. A lively
tassel made of leather fringe finishes the headgear.

This bit of seashell is obviously a piece of a huge shell; you 
can tell by the size of the rills on its other side. The shard,
vaguely conical in shape, fits comfortably in your hand. Now you
just need to figure out where it could have come from.
