A case of hard, oiled black leather provides a safe, waterproof environment for
the precious instruments carried within.  A crescent moon has been worked into
the leather casing and dyed a bright silver color, marking the case as
originating from the stores of Lokari himself.  Shaped rather like a pear, it
looks like it was made to contain some kind of stringed instrument with a short
neck.  A black strap embroidered with patterns of stars attaches to either end
of the case, and it looks like it could be comfortably worn slung over a
shoulder.

extradesc: diadem sunstone golden strange gleaming sunstone-diadem
Light seems to flow naturally from this ancient golden medallion.  Symbols of
what look like stars in the heavens are spread across it, and there is a symbol
of the sun dominating its center.

extradesc: mandolin wooden-instrument teardrop-shaped-body
The mandolin is fairly light for its size, made of a thin yet durable walnut
wood and skillfully stained in patterns of six-pointed flowers on the
teardrop-shaped sounding board.  The neck is also stained dark, and the tuning
pegs are made of a fine silver that doesn't seem to tarnish with use.  The
strings are paired in four groups, for a total of eight, giving it a
characteristic way of being plucked to form chords.  Its deep body makes for a
full sound, and its tone is quite pleasant to listen to.

Cast from an odd white metal, the outside of these greaves are cold as ice,
but can withstand quite a bit of damage.  They are padded on the inside with
white fur, preventing the frigid white metal from touching skin.  The plate
metal is slightly curved and much thinner than average steel, undoubtedly
created by some uncomprehensible elven miracle.

extradesc: white dragon scale white-dragon-scale
About as large as a human's palm, this pure white scale comes from the tender
shoulder area of a white dragon.  It is a beautiful scale, shining brightly in
the light and feeling slightly cool to the touch.  Dragons are very magical
creatures, so the scale would probably be valuable to a researching sorcerer or
anyone else interested in unlocking the power of a dragon's skin.
