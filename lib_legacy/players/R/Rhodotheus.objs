This finely woven cloak is made of pure white satin with cotton embroidery
marking out an abstract bird symbol on the back which, though it is also in
white, shows up in string light due to the difference in luster between the two
fabrics.  Long ties at the neck can be used to fasten the cloak against the
chill winds of the north.  It looks like it would also make great camoflauge in

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  The tattoo is a highly realistic black image
of a hawk's wing, with intricate details that capture the texture and shape of
the feathers.  The use of shading and highlights creates a sense of depth and
movement in the feathers.  It incorporates intricate swirls in the details of
the feathers, evoking the image of the moving air.~

Faceplates like this were issued in the early days of the campaign to sack

Caelia.  They became keepsakes for the soldiers who fought in that campaign
after Ogakh was established as a permanent settlement and most of the Army
conscripted to town guard duty.~

It is constructed of a round frame of branches over which the skins of buffalo
have been stretched.  It looks like it's limited to a single human-sized
occupant.  The bottom is stained much darker than the rest, apparently due to
the body of water in which it has spent much time: Black Lake.    ~

Basil is a sweet, mintlike herb that can be ground into a fine spice.  It has
no known magical properties, but it goes really well with tomatoes in sauces
and other dishes.  The larger leaves can also be added to soup for a weaker
flavor.    ~

extradesc: blade bright-white-blade
This blade shines with a bright light whenever it is in the presence of 
something or someone good.  It is used by the Undead Lord to protect his
mausoleum and afterlife.  Being so white it is difficult to perceive exactly
where the edges are, so I'd be careful with it.~

extradesc: spear obsidian-spear crude-spear-obsidian-head
This spear has a short haft and a broad obsidian head.  It has poor balance and
you doubt that it would make an effective missile weapon.  However the obsidian
head is very sharp, and you feel confident you could inflict a great deal of
damage with it.~

extradesc: broadsword broad-sword alabaster-pommelled-broadsword alabaster-pommel
This large weapon is a two-handed sword with a very long blade made of steel
with very little in the way of sharp edges, since it's meant for brute hacking.
The hilt is made of bronze, with bronze crossguards and little ornamentation
or decoration.  The pommel is weighted perfectly with a smooth white alabaster
stone, opaque and milky-white.  There is no sign of what the stone signifies.~

The helm is forged of a silver metal of the highest quality, giving it extreme
strength.  It appears to have been painted or layered with a blue colored
metallic substance, giving off a bluish tinted shine.  The back of the helm
comes down to cover the neckline and at the front there is a piece that drops
downward to cover the nasal area.~

Named for the Demon Lord Yeenoghu's holy weapon, this massive and deadly triple
flail is not in fact the real artifact, though it is an impressive replica and
still extremely potent.  Weapons such as these are carried by Fangs of
Yeenoghu, warrior-shamans imbued directly with a demonic spirit by Yeenoghu
himself.  This one has three spike-headed orbs dangling from long chains,
attached to a sturdy haft.  A bulging eye is drawn on each orb in blood, an
invocation of Yeenoghu to watch the butchery committed in his name.~
