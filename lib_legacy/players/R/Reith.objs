This apple is large, round, and speckled with small brown spots.  It looks as

past its peak ripeness, but is still good.

This tiny burning mote shines brightly with an orangey-yellow light.  Its light

Though difficult to look at, it feels like a hard little pea, or perhaps a bead
of glass.

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.
