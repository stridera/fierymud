When examined closely, it is easy to see the necklace was constructed hastily
with clumsy hands.  The teeth vary in shape and size making you wonder if more
than bat teeth were used.  Even with all of its flaws, you can tell the
necklace held some significance to the owner.~

This small pair of yellow orbs are actually a set of tiny snake eyes, carefully
preserved in some kind of resin.  They are a brilliant yellow with a vertically
elliptical pupil in the middle.  This thin tattoo lays right on one eyebrow,
curving over the ridge like the natural curve of a snake's fang.  The fang is
highly detailed to represent a real snake's fang and shaded to match the
contours of the brow ridge.  Brilliant yellow highlights give an animalistic
pop to the overall image.~

  &3&b***POINTS OF INTEREST***&0
   |&1&b1&0: There are far too many interesting things that go on in the theatre to 
   |   list them all here.  The players also tend to roam around theatre so
   |   pinning them to one spot is impossible.  So start here, talk to the
   |   Leading Player, and enjoy the magic (and madness) of... The Theatre!

Pog's notes on the Brushland Region:
Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food
make this area a haven for all sorts of creatures of the forest.

My soul is happy to see this.~

This appears to be the work of an apprentice, for crude lines are drawn roughly
all across its surface.  The somewhat faint silvery lines have a discernable
metallic gleam.  Most of the lines are drawn in one of two orthogonal
directions, parallel to one or the other of the mostly rectangular edges of the
document.  Four other lines drawn at acute angles create a diamond in the
middle, albeit somewhat distorted.~

fieryness into its holder, promising power and strength to its wearer.~
