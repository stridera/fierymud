extradesc: staff electricity
   The blue and white bolts crackle and sizzle, but still are bound together to
form a staff.  The top of the staff burns the brightest and emits an occasional
shower of sparks.  It is constantly shifting colors and shape, allowing the
user to control it actions to achieve maximum damage.

A brownish color on the outside and a cream color within, the small cake of
elven waybread looks about as delicious as a bread can be.  Unlike other
similar-appearing waybreads, this cake crumbles delightfully, releasing a
scrumptious aroma.  It is rumored that elven waybread is far more nutritious
than any human food, and that it is closely guarded by the elves and is only
rarely awarded to others.
