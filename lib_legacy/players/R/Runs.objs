You can tell that only royalty could have afforded to make these.
Made of some dark-green metal alloy, these bracers, made to fit
and buckle around a very large arm, are worked in a cunning
scrolling design. They're obviously very old, as well; the metal
feels worn in places, as though decades of contact with the same
arms have altered their shape slightly.

you put your ear against its softly thrumming surface, you can
hear what seems to be a lullaby, in a strong female voice touched

Many creatures make these grasses their home.
Abundant water in the southwest, and plenty of food

floating within it. Before you can decide what lies within, you are

This crown seems pretty heavy. It's made of thick gold, and probably
incredibly expensive. The gold is shaped into the traditional peaks of 
crowns. A green emerald, marquise-cut, is set into each peak, and several 
of them in various cuts adorn the very front of the crown's tallest peak,
which would be centered over the wearer's forehead.

This is a stained old bucket made of wood.  It is rather stout and has a handle
oneach side.  It appears to have been used quite a lot, yet it doesn't leak.
