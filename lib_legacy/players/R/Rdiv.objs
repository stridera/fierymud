extradesc: belt emblazoned baldric
This large, wide belt goes around the waist, up over the shoulders,      
to support a sword's sheath. A lion rampant adorns the front of
it, where it goes across the stomach. The baldric seems very
old; its owner hasn't taken good care of it -- the leather is
cracked in places.
