Oct 16 2023 -BIG UPDATE!
     - NPCs can now give you items beyond your carrying capacity or weight limits.  No more quest 
       items getting stuck in a mob's inventory because you couldn't hold it!  BUT be warned, 
       if you go fighting afterds, and fall down, it's all on you!
     - Spell durations should now properly refresh if re-cast before the duration expires. Not all 
       spells will do this.  Help files have been updated to indicate which ones do or do not.
     - REVISED STAT CAPS
          -For a long time now, any boosts to a stat at 100 were totally lost.  Since many players
           start with their key stats near or at 100, this meant developing rewards targeted at 
           specific classes was often difficult and counter-intuitive.
     - Visible stats no longer cap at 100!  In fact, they have no visible limit.
           - This means stats will continue to scale based on your race's scaling factor until it 
             reaches an internal limit, which will not be visible.  This limit is higher than it 
             was previously for all stats of all races.  That might mean a visible score of 
             anywhere from 100 to up to over 500!
     - Characters cannot start with a visible stat higher than 100.
     - Ogres, trolls, and nymphs have had some of their racial scale percentages reduced slightly 
       to fit with this new system.
     - REVISED RACIAL CLASS RESTRICTIONS
          - Fiery has slowly gravitated away from our AD&&D origins where classes had heavy race 
            restrictions.  While we haven't completely abandoned the deterministic nature of the 
            races, we are letting go of many of the tight restrictions classes had previously.
          - Races will only be restricted from classes that violate their fundamental natures 
            in some way.
          - Examples include elves being barred from being anti-paladins, diabolists, or 
            necromancers, or fire dragonborn being unable to become pyromancers.
          - Each race's and class's help file has been updated to reflect these changes.     
       --These changes have been brought to you by Daedela and Strider, 
       --you should thank them if you like the changes!

Nov 15 2023 -big news HERE
          The spell casting system is in the final stages of testing!  From Friday to Tuesday 
          we will be in in radical test mode to let players try out the new spell casting system 
          live!  Based on how this goes, we'll determine if we're ready to make this our 
          permanent system yet.  We think we have the major kinks worked out, but we need as 
          much input as we can get.
          
          Radical testing mode means any character changes made during the weekend will not be 
          saved to ensure nothing goes horribly wrong with your characters due to unforseen bugs.
          This includes levels gained or equipment found, but anyone who logs in will receive 
          special thank yous from Daedela when testing is complete.
           
          Note: recovery times are set based on assumed Focus bonuses. They may be longer than 
                intended if your gear is not up to that baseline.

Nov 20 2023
         Radical test mode was a success. The new spell system is now REAL.  details are--
    *Spell Recovery*
       - Since we are removing pray and memorize, we're instead of using those words or 
         "preparation" time, we're calling the refresh time the spell's "recovery" time.
       - All spells will have a base recovery time determined by the circle of the spell, 
         much as it is now.
       - Currently, recovery time is set in real-time seconds.
       - Recovery time will &bnot&0 be impacted by character level any longer.
       - The recovery timer will start the second after the spell is successfully cast 
         allowing spells to recover passively while active play continues.
       - Spells will recover one at a time in the order cast.
       - Meditate will remain a skill and command, which will reduce the time 
         necessary to recover spell slots proportionate to your current skill level.
       - Recovery time will be adjusted by a calculation of your stats based on your class.
       - Recovery time may also be adjusted by your race.
       - We are adding a new item bonus which will also decrease spell recovery time!  We are 
         This bonus is called Focus, and you will see it in your score.
       - Ultimately, minimum recovery time will be 1 second per spell slot, just as it is now.
       - We will also be able to introduce potions that instantly reduce recovery time!

Nov 29 2023
       - Fixed piercing weapon bug.

Dec 31 2023
       - Diabolists can enjoy some new boons from their demonic gods in the form of evolving 
         weapons.  A small beachside cult holds the secrets to gaining demonic favor.
       - A mini quest has been added to the Barrow for those who want to be the champion 
         of the dead.
       - Physical weapons that deal energy damage can now be used with skills they intuitively 
         should fit; ie a flaming sword can be used for an assassin's throatcut and will benefit 
         from the slashing weapons skill, a dagger of ice can be used to backstab and will 
         benefit from the piercing weapon skill, etc.
       - These weapons will also confer the better of their two damage types when calculating 
         composition susceptibility; ie using a flaming sword against a water elemental will be 
         treated as a slashing weapon when calculating evasion and damage adjustment, but will 
         still deal fire damage.
       - Sorcerer phase wands will continue to do pure elemental damage and not benefit from 
         any weapon skill.
       - the blade of Chaos has become a smiting sword.

Jan 04 2024
       - CORE COMMAND CHANGE - MAJOR UPDATE FOR ALL PLAYERS
            In trying to make basic commands more intuitive for native English speakers, the 
            "level gain" command has been shortened and is now simply "level."  Using the "level" 
            command away from your guild master will show you your progress toward your next 
            level as it always has.

       - SPELL UPDATE
            The poison spell has been reworked to inflict more damage more frequently but for a 
            shorter duration.  It should actually be worth casting on mobs for damage now!
            but beware, it's going to be a bit more potent when you are poisioned! 

       - Bug fixes
            As always with bug fixes, if you continue to see the problem, please let us know!
            - The gods have intervened and taken away the unlimited spellcasting power of the 
              denizens of the realm.  Mobs will no longer cast infinitely!  
              Please report any issues with mob spell recovery time.
            - The gods have also tried to reign in the chaos of illusion magic.  Illusions 
              should no longer kick their creators for no apparent reason.
            - Adjusted the stun delay when casting a 2* spell so it properly lags the caster 
              and prevents a "You are busy spellcasting..." error.
            - Fixed a rare bug that occurred when trying to use an elemental weapon to 
              backstab or throatcut.
            - Addressed an issue with groups receiving proper credit for completing quest steps.
              If side effects arise, we will address them ASAP and make sure 
              everyone gets their goodies!
            - Fixed random crash when fighting some mobs.
Jan 06 2024 Minor bug-fixes
            - Fixed another 'you are too busy spellcasting' messages.
            - Further God smack-down on Illusionists magic, that attack their masters.


Jan 14 2024 More updates
         - Monk powers continue to grow.  Monks now have two chant cooldowns, one for 
           aggressive songs and one for support songs.  They also have a powerful new skill,
           roundhouse, which works like hitall but for kicking!
         - Kick has also been upgraded significantly for all classes.
         - Rangers, until now lacking any kind of AOE, now get chain lightning at circle 11.
         - Bards that come from races with naturally lower Charisma will see the number of 
           times they can perform has increased!
         - Elves have become Fiery's first official spellcasting &urace&0!  All elf characters 
           now receive magic missile at circle 1.  Not just a fancy innate, but the whole 
           dang spell!  If you already knew magic missile... sorry, nothing new then.  
           For everyone else, the spell has been added to your list of known spells.  
           Spellcasting classes can cast race spells like any other spell they know.  If you
           need a spellbook to cast your spells, you'll need to scribe magic missile before 
           you can use it.  If you didn't have any spells before, you do now!  You can cast 
           it without a book just like a cleric or paladin!  Elves that are not a spellcasting 
           class will not receive the specialist skills spell knowledge, 
           meditate, or quick chant however.
         - We hope to build on this foundation in the future, creating greater growth for 
           players based on their racial choices as well as their class choices.
         - A new shadow fang earring is floating around the Outer Planes, tailored for those 
           who wield infernal maigcs.  It is very similar to an earring guarded fiercely by 
           the Frost Elves.
         - The attack requirements for the early stages of the sorcerer wands have been 
           shortened to match the requirements of the later stages.
         - Skills command has been updated to better show progress. Help skill command will
           be updated shortly to give more detail around how the display works. 
           
Jan 15 2024 -game updates
         -Arre Matu, grand initiator for the Way of the Monk, has relocated her home out of 
          the Stone Temple to a setting more appropriate for a master of the martial arts.  
          The trek is difficult for new heroes, but those who have uncovered the secrets of 
          the Old Merchant Trail will find their way there faster than a shooting star.

Jul 06 2024 -- minor update
         - Wimpy bug has been squashed. The value should save properly now.

Dec 11 2024 -- minor world update
            - The Green Woman in Anduin is having a grand reopening!  She's

              potions, all randomly sourced each reset.  Swing by and see 
              what she has on offer.
