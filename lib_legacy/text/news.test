   -- Several minor display bug fixes implemeted.
   -- ** HUGE UPGRADE ** -- target matching. What this means is:
      if there is an astronomically large demon in the room, and
      you type kill ast -- it will attack that demon.  
      *BUT BE WARRNED* if there is also a astral guard in the room
      as well, you will attack whichever is 'first in the room'
      With great power, comes great responsibility!

      backup of current MUD.  We upload the new code, test for 48+
      hours. When we're done, we restore, and everything goes back 
      to that point. So anything you ever wanted to try, but were 
      scared, that would be the time!!
 NOTE:: You will see a RATICAL TEST MODE banner when you log in-- 
        if you don't -- it's not in radical test mode yet!
Nov 10 2020
   -- New elemental wand weapons are selling at the magic shops across 
      Ethilien.  The wands kick off four 90-level game-wide upgrade 
      quests! The master crafters are a whole host of familiar faces.
      
      These are similar to the armor quests given by guild masters and use 
      a variety of the armor gems and additional tasks and components.  
      Unlike the armor quests though, the wands themselves are the base 
      components for all future steps, so don't lose them!
