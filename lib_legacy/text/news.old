    -- The elemental wands have had their elements added to their name lists.
    -- We're releasing a new kind of trigger which may impact the function of the bounty
       hunt contracts, assignments, and notices.  We don't anticipate any changes in behavior,

       sometimes fails to advance Berix's bounty hunt quest.
    -- A new system for tracking your quest progress, a personalized journal, is available for

       can be replaced at no cost as long as you don't currently have one in your inventory.
       The information is unique to the character looking at it, so giving your journal to
       another character will not share your information.  WARNING: This system will have
       bugs and visual inconsistencies.  Please message Daedela via Discord or email
       directly if/when you encounter any.  Include screenshots if possible.

    -- Using Faerie Step without a target will no longer crash the game.
    -- The higher a character gets in level, the further casting time is reduced for lower
       level spells when successfully quick chanting.  The maximum reduction varies depending
       on if the spell is a "combat" spell (damage, healing, debuff, or stone skin) or not.
       Quick Chant also factors Intelligence and Wisdom into casting time.
    -- A bug with displacement has been fixed so it will succeed far less often now.
    -- A bug in rescue has been fixed.
    -- Cartwheel will now correctly begin combat even if both the attacker and the target

       command if they fall down.
    -- Cartwheel's success rates have been significantly adjusted.
    -- Rend will now remove armor spells first, then reduce base AC on a second use.

    -- Invisibility no longer displays the wear off message twice to the person becoming visible.

    -- Bards no longer receive Heal and Harm.
    -- Three new ranger spells!
          1. Nimble: gives the ranger an additional attack with their off-hand weapon, much like
             Haste does for the primary weapon.  Stacks with Haste and Blur.  Self only.
          2. Displacement: confers a 20% chance to evade incoming attacks.  Does not impact
             spells.  Self only.
          3. Greater Displacement: confers a 33% chance to evade incoming attacks.  Does not
             impact spells.  Does not stack with Displacement.  Self only.  Quest spell.

   -- Several minor display bug fixes implemeted.
   -- ** HUGE UPGRADE ** -- target matching. What this means is:
      if there is an astronomically large demon in the room, and
      you type kill ast -- it will attack that demon.

      as well, you will attack whichever is 'first in the room'

      scared, that would be the time!!
 NOTE:: You will see a RATICAL TEST MODE banner when you log in--
        if you don't -- it's not in radical test mode yet!

Nov 10 2020
   -- New elemental wand weapons are selling at the magic shops across
      Ethilien.  The wands kick off four 90-level game-wide upgrade
      quests! The master crafters are a whole host of familiar faces.

      These are similar to the armor quests given by guild masters and use
      a variety of the armor gems and additional tasks and components.
      Unlike the armor quests though, the wands themselves are the base
      components for all future steps, so don't lose them!

Oct 14 2022
   -- New build -- couple updates
   -- You can now pick up items that are up to 15 levels above your current
      level, but you still can't use them.

      of ill-repute.

      slightly ambiguous. As such, the labels have been updated slightly.

Dec 28 2021

   -- There is a new type of item now available!
        Some might call it 'a hover slot' but it's a new type of

        be, a light that follows you, and hovers above your shoulder.
   -- Basic windows telnet now works.
   -- Pet stores now have offset colors, to make it easier to see.  This
      is a work in progress, and will eventually be added to all stores.

Nov 13 2020
   -- Several area updates -- as follows:
  * The Theatre: 
   --The Theatre should be a bit quieter now.  Mob random chance speech 
     triggers reduced in frequency.  They've also been talking elocution 
     lessons to speak more slowly so you can catch up to what they're saying.
    --You'll no longer look like you're wearing the eyelashes of a dead 
      person.  Catherine assures us (and the world) her lashes are fake.  
      Also, they can be called "lashes" now.  And If you bring her the dressing
      room key but not her lashes, she'll ask you for another favor.
    --Charlemagne's sash is a little easier to identify from the pile of 
      other clothes that look just like it.
    --The Fire Goddess is tired of waiting for Pippin.  She's a bit more 
      explicit with her instructions.
---That is all for now
---Chinok

   *Odaishyozen:
    --Overall, did a passover to reduce Orientalist trends in the zone without 
      removing the obvious flavor of magic and furikake.
    --Names of clothes from this island have been localized to their native
      language and are much prettier to look at!
    --A few rooms have been renamed and their descriptions updated to reflect
      what they actually are in traditional arts.
    --Removed references to the people on this island being "slant-eyed" 
      because it's 2020 and even in Caelia we don't need to be describing
      people that way anymore.
    --The Goddess has gone through immigration and has accepted a new name!
      She will now be known as Kannon, Goddess of Mercy, though she 
      (and that wall) will still respond to her old name Kwan Yin.

     *Fiery has been running on a 32 bit outdated server OS for about 2 years.
      We will need to update the server to a current version, 64 bit OS.
      Unfortunatly, that means some downtime to upgrade.  We are looking at the 
      weekend of April 26-27 for the upgrade. This will take us some time, but 
      NOTHING will be lost, and it should provide some performance gains  
      (less lag).  This is one of those things we must do, so just be prepared
      for it, and don't freak out when you see firey down the weekend of 
      the 26-27.

      *Check out the website.  There's a new 'Connect NOW!' button
       at the top of the screen that will connect you to our flash
       based MUDD client.  It has support for aliases and triggers,
       but make sure you save them, as it don't keep up with them
       itself.  but you can play from work now! :)
       I'm working on a help page for the client, but I think most
       of you can figure it out.  As always, let me know if you have
       questions, forum, email, or mudmail.

      *Fall has fallen, and forced changes in the Blue-Fog Area.
       The region has been rebalanced to have more consistant 
       difficulties more managable compostions, and some new mobs.
       The new levels are: 
           trail:   30-45 
           river    40-60 
           mountain 55-80
       Let us know if you see anything that don't look right

      *Just in time for spring Fashions...
      All of the Phase 3 Armor quest items (but 3) have been updated,
      some major, some minor.  To help you get the newest versions 
      of these armors, as well as any other updated items 
      (like the monocle), search out Tr'ven, he has set up shop 
      in Mielikki. 
      
      *If there's a piece of quest armor you have earned, but you just
       can't tell where it ran off to, contact Ramah via mudmail, and 
       he will help you out.  Before you decide to cheat, yes, he 
       can tell if you've earned it :)
               ---Chinok & Ramah


*March 29, 2013
      * Monks have been slightly tweeked.  Overall, their damange was 
      increased, but you may notice a little less damage at lower
      levels.  Let us know if	something don't look right.  Yuhen 
      wants to see monks hit 6 time per round, (at less damage 
      of course) so this tweeking might not be done just yet.

      * Trainers now have their own rooms in Mielikki, you may have to 
      search them out, but it's worth the trouble.
                ---Chinok


*March 22, 2013
      Skill trainers are now available around the town of Mielikki.
      These profesional trainers will take a few of your hard earned
      platinum, to help you increase your skills.  Of course they wont
      allow you to increase your skill past your level, but it might be
      easier than backstabbing 5000 bugs.
                --Let us know if there are any issues with them
                --Chinok


*August 04, 2012
      A ranger has been added to Morgan Hill, to help save newbies
      under level 10.  We haven't had a lot of newbies to save lately,
      so I thought it important to save the ones we have.
                      --Happy Mudding
                     ---Chinok


*July 20, 2012
     A few new items have been added to the website.  There is now a 
        stats page that shows who's been logged in recently.  There's 
        also the famous death counts, always fun to look at. The death
        counts are always current up to the last game reset, and the logins 
        are updated every 5 minutes. 
   --Also, NEWS that's posted here, automatically shows up on the website
        now.  So you can see game updates in both places! 
                        --- Hope you enjoy!

     The retirement of Fierymud may have been greatly exaggerated.  
     We.re back, on a new server, and will continue to run as long
     as I can support it.  We have some new features planned that 
     I hope you will enjoy as well.  So please keep playing, and 
     remind your friends we are still here, and they should 
     come join us.
                                                     --Chinok


* June 30, 2012
      Thank you all for playing and helping with FieryMUD over the decades
      that she has been running.  It has been immeasurebly fun over the
      years but my time for the mud has come and gone.  I have offered the
      code and parts of FieryMUD to each of the people subscribing to the
      gods email list and stated that if one of them choses to run the mud
      I would not object.  The time for my retirement has come at last.
      I've not set a date yet, but I suspect that the 28th of July will be
      the last day I host the FieryMUD systems.  If one of the gods steps
      up and claims that they want to host the mud, I'll post more detals.

      Thank you all again, and may you slay many dragons.

    o The terrain type Cave has been implemented. This should enable
      many spells that were wrongly disabled underground previously.

   ~~~~~~~ FieryMUD News ~~~~~~~

      * Ice Cult
      	- The entrance of the area has been made less lowbee friendly,
	  to better reflect it's intended level.
      * Frost Valley

	  difficulty level.
      * Cathedral of Betrayal
    o Abbey’s key’s are back where they aught to be.
    o The Logging Camp quest should be online now.

      scrolls.
						    - Yuhen

		    	    	      	   	    - Ramah

* March 2, 2012
    o Logging Camp (15-20) has actually been added.

						     - Yuhen

* February 8, 2012
    o A new area has just been added bridging the Great Road and 
      Nikozian Trail: Logging Camp (15-20)
    - Logging Camp is primerily good-neutral aligned.
    - The Camp itself has some shops selling goods useful for
       lumberjacks, explorers, or those lacking is supplies otherwise
       purchased in town.
    - As a side perk, with this area in-game a previously-missing
      piece to the Hermits instructions is now available for the Rhell
      Forest quest.
    o Several objects in the world have been updated:
    - 2H weapons at all levels have been updated to produce viable
      damage.
    - Many hard-to-get items that were previously not very valuable,
      have been updated. Updated areas include:

      item level, stats and area difficulty.
						     - Yuhen

      instead of piercing damage.

* January 9, 2012
    o A few items have just been updated:
      - The merchant in Rhell Forest (between twisted and blue fog) 
        now has a dynamic quest available.
      - The druids quest in Twisted Forest is back online.
      - A few fixes to Rhell Forest and Sacred Haven have been made.
                                                     - Yuhen

* January 3, 2012
    o A new area, the The Rhell Forest is out in the Twisted Forest
      and connects to Blue Fog.  Levels 45-55, I hope you all get
      killed many times.  - Zzur

* October 10, 2011
    o The limit of only having two characters on at once has been
      suspended until such time that FieryMUD has a huge player-
      base again.  Since I suspect that text based RPG's glory days
      have passed, this may well be permenant.  I hope you all find
      more enjoyment with the mud.  - Zzur

* April 3, 2011
    - New Area: Split Skull
      This area is an evil village that is set in opposition to the 
      abbey by the Black Legion.  To combat their influence the
      Eldorian court has dispatched an Emissary to the Abbey as well.
      Players 8 to 20 are encouraged to take sides in the fight.
      If you are good, go help raid the new zone!
    - Split Skull is north of the Enchanted Hollow, but beware it has
      an entrance into the Mystwatch swamps where it all seems to look
      the same.  The rangers have yet to make it over to protect that
      area.
    - I believe Split Skull is production ready, but it was so long 
      in development and so rarely worked on there may be tons of
      holes the quests and play.  Let us know what you find if stuff
      doesn't work.

* March 18, 2011
    - FieryMUD is now running on new hardware.  Technical difficulties
      may occur, but we will work hard to minimize any inconvenience.
      Thank you for your patience.

* July 2, 2010
    - Shrynn, Lord of the Air, now wields a fearsome new stick.  You
      are warned.

* June 25, 2010
    - The bulletin board has been archived.  Old posts may now be read
      in the Templar Magistrate's room northwest of the Mielikki Town 
      Fountain.

* July 17, 2009
    - The Paladin phase 3 armor quest has been moved from the Knight
      Errant to Belward in Sacred Haven.

* July 14, 2009

      challenges.  Participants will compete using new characters to 
      attempt to be named Fiery's fastest!

      All participants will receive rewards and winners will receive 
      their choice from a set of predetermined quest equipment or 
      permanent stat increases on one of their characters.

      participate and have fun in this quest!  See the player bulletin 
      board for rules, prizes, and more information.

      flag when detect magic is active.

      casting for a short amount of time.
    - Gaining a level will now heal to full.

* June 20, 2009
    - Help files for spells and skills have been updated to
      present more information in a standardized way!

* June 10, 2009
    - Prompts can now display cooldowns for various skills,
      such as lay hands, shapechange, and throatcut.  See
      &bhelp prompt&0 for a complete list or try &bdisplay 9&0 to
      see the first aid cooldown in action.
    - Clans have been completely reimplemented.  They mostly
      work the same, but the clan command should be somewhat
      easier to use.  Also, certain events are now broadcast
      to members of the clan, such as level-ups and deaths.
    - The amount of damage that breath attacks inflict has
      been decreased by about 40%.

* March 21, 2009
    - Pyromancers have new spells:
        * Detonation
        * Phosphoric embers
        * Positive field
        * Acid burst
      The spells combust and heatwave have been retired.
    - Cryomancers get the waterwalk spell in circle 1.
    - The soul tap spell now has a slow, life-draining effect.
    - Bulletin boards have received a complete makeover.  One
      note: you must now type 'write board <subject>' to post.
    - You can get a specific amount of items:

      > get 4 bread
      > get 3 gem 2.bag

* March 17, 2009
    - The 'spells' command has been improved.
    - Some objects won't fall.

* March 13, 2009
    - The detect poison spell now works more like detect magic,
      giving a person the ability to detect poison for a while.
    - First aid has been made more useful.
    - Most fluid or non-corporeal creatures won't leave behind
      a corpse when killed.
    - The exits and scan commands were tweaked a bit.

* February 4, 2009
    - After using summon mount, (Anti-)Paladins won't have to wait
      a week to summon a new one; the cooldown is now 12 hours
      since the mount is lost.
    - The guard skill now works on NPCs.
    - New emote's command lets you do stuff like:
      > emote's arms flail wildly as he falls over!
      <> Laochan's arms flail wildly as he falls over!
    - Damage amounts now visible for damage done by soulshield,
      fireshield, and coldshield.
    - Creatures that armor themselves magically will no longer
      manage to get -2000 ac and be unhittable. *yay*

    - Waterform has become a quest spell.

* September 10, 2008
    - Odaishyozen has been touched up a bit. See if you can find
      the new items!

* September 7, 2008
    - Equipment used to become weightless when you wore it.  Now it
      will continue to have weight.  This will disrupt some folks'
      carefully apportioned kits, so the weight limit has been increased
      accordingly.
    - Objects will now generally disappear from the game if left
      unattended for too long.  Basically, if a player handles something
      and then gets rid of it, OR if an object falls to the ground from
      a decomposing corpse, it will disappear after a while.
      Also, player corpses will take even longer to decompose.
    - When you're very close to your weight limit, you'll be too
      heavy to fly.

* August 31, 2008
    - The towns of Mielikki, Anduin, and Ickle won't tolerate evil
      pets any more, and the guards will attack them on sight.
      Necromancers especially should take care.
    - Town guards are more protective of players and will help them
      out in a fight, instead of taking the NPC's side like they used
      to do. There is an exception: if you're fighting a guard or
      other valued townsperson, the guards WILL still attack you.
    - The new toggles have been renamed ExpandObjs and ExpandMobs.

* August 30, 2008
    - The StackObjs and StackMobs toggles can now be used to control
      whether you see multiples of the same object or mobile on a
      single line when you look in a room, a container, or your inventory.
    - The 'abandon' command allows you to leave behind folks who are
      following you.

* August 24, 2008
    - Adventurers may be excited to learn that a way exists into
      Technitzitlan that doesn't involve falling. Good luck finding it.
    - NPCs won't have unlimited spells any longer.

* August 21, 2008
    - According to word of mouth, a new resort up north has opened
      its doors to the public! Phoenix Feather Hot Springs should be
      a good challenge for those of you in the 55-60 range.
    - There is no longer a damage type of "magic". The magic missile
      spell now does piercing damage. Bigby's Fist does crushing damage
      and disintegrate does acid damage.

* August 17, 2008
    - You can edit your description in the game with the 'desc' command.
    - By player suggested idea your trophy will clear when you die,
      unless you're questing. This was a good idea submitted long ago
      but we're going through them all and going to give each its due.
      Some quests require you to get a list of creatures on your trophy.
      Gods who assign quests are responsible for marking players as
      'questing' or not.

* August 16, 2008
    - A hundred or so player submitted ideas have been addressed
      and the responses are in the forums.  These ideas span all
      the way back to the first week this current version of the
      code was active.

* August 12, 2008
    - Some sorcerer single-target attack spells were recalibrated.
    - NPCs are affected by laryngitis.  This sad affliction has
      descended upon them due to the corruption of the Necromancer
      class by nefarious agents.

* August 10, 2008
    - Due to insufficient demand, the weapon slinging feature has
      been retired.
    - The operation of the sense life spell has changed. Our
      long-time players may recognize its behavior being very close
      to the original spell. In keeping with the concept of life
      forces, it now depends on the susceptibility to healing magic.
      As a result, purely magical creatures cannot be sensed with
      this spell.
    - Heatwave and Cone of Cold was fixed.  You'll have to discover
      that that means.

* April 17, 2008
    - Hitroll and Armor Class points are now individually significant.
      Previously, you had to roll over the 10s digit to gain any
      benifit - for example, 19 was no better than 10.  Now every
      point counts.

* April 12, 2008
    - The AUTOTREAS toggle can be used to merely loot treasure,
      such as coins and gems, from your kills.

* April 4, 2008
    - The split command now randomly chooses who gets
      the 'leftovers'.
    - There are two new toggles: autoloot and autosplit.
      See HELP AUTOLOOT and HELP AUTOSPLIT.
    - The movement point cost for using the disarm skill
      has been changed.
    - Bashed mobs will stay down a bit longer.

* March 28, 2008
    - When you are in a fluid state due to the Waterform or
      Vaporform spell, you won't be able to pick up or accept
      objects.
    - Creatures are resistant to various types of damage
      according to their composition.  For example, ice creatures
      will be immune to cold, but vulnerable to crushing. See
      HELP COMPOSITION for more information.
    - Creatures are also vulnerable to certain attacks according
      to their life force.  See HELP LIFE FORCE for more
      information.
    - Spectres, ghosts, and other creatures with no physical
      form are generally invulnerable to physical attacks.
      However, the bless and dark presence spells can help
      fighters destroy these beings.  See HELP BLESS and
      HELP DARK PRESENCE.
    - The above changes represent a major change to Fiery's
      combat system, so rebalancing is likely.  Please use the
      BUG or PETITION commands if you see any inconsistencies
      or imablances.

* March 11, 2008
    - With the NoClanTell toggle, you can suppress messages from your
      clan channel.

* February 11, 2008
    - There's a new toggle: nohint.  You can use it to choose whether
      to get the names of similar commands when you enter a typo or
      nonexistent command.
    - Did you know that most of the subclass quests were broken?
      Well, they got fixed.
    - Hide was acting up too. It got fixed.
    - Deities will be able to "hotboot" the mud so that it restarts
      without disconnecting everyone.  Other than that, it will be
      like a normal reboot.

* February 5, 2008
    - Scavenger mobs have been fixed.
    - Players can now be assigned several titles for their good
      (or nefarious) deeds. You can choose which of your titles to
      display at any time.

* January 26, 2008
    - Area Updates:
	o A couple of the Eldoria quests were repaired.
	o A large number of phase armor quests that were broken should
	  be functional now.  Post in the forums if they are not.
	o Princess Signess shouldn't hide anymore.

* January 21, 2008
    - You can drag incapacitated players who have consented you.
    - Spellcasters won't receive skills they can't use.
    - Observations made using infravision are more detailed.
    - The "attributes" command now shows unmodified HP and MV.
    - Quite a number of scripts and quests have been updated to take
      advantage of some code improvements.  Let us know if any of
      them cease working.
    - Some mobs (like assassin and warriors) will now fight back using
      various skills, like kick and hitall.  Look out for thieves with loose
      hands too.  Also, spellcasters will now cast spells more specific to
      their class too.
    - The exp bar will now appear on your score, and also displays your
      progress to the next level with greater precision.  The * shows
      your overall progress towards the next level, and the = marks
      show your progress between * gradations.
    - You can use the 'aggr' command to make yourself aggressive, and
      to preemptively attack mobiles that would attack you. 

* December 25, 2007
    - Merry Christmas!! and a Ho Ho Ho!!
    - There was a bug that prevented says from being seen by other 
      players in the room with you.  This has been fixed.
    - Some bug associated with fly has been fixed.
    - There was an error in weight calculations that allowed players
      carrying so much weight they would be crushed to be able to move
      around still.. fixed!
    - The armor bug has been fixed and should actually help your AC
      instead of making it worse.

* December 24, 2007
    - Merry Christmas!!
    - Clans have been redesigned from scratch, and should eliminate
      some of the previously experienced bugs.  Some snazzy new
      features have been introduced with the new design, including
      descriptions, alts, and the ability to enroll, promote, demote,
      or expel someone when they aren't even online!  See 'help clan'
      for more info.
    - The score command now almost always shows the numbers behind the
      descriptive text, even for newbies.  Some of the descriptive
      messages have changed to be shorter (current load) or more
      accurate (exp progress).  Some of these changes also affect the
      attributes command.
    - Several new command codes are available for prompt, including
      hiddenness, alignment, your name, exp, and active spells!  See
      'help prompt' for descriptions of each code.
    - Or if you're too lazy to figure that all out, try one of the
      two new preset displays (just type 'display' to see them).
      They show alignment, hiddenness, exp to the next level, and
      active spells.  

* December 10, 2007
    - Transient objects should behave better once picked up. 
    - Numerous long standing crash bugs fixed. 
    - Instakill will now have a chance to improve skill on failure. 
    - Steal will have a slightly better chance of success if hidden. 
    - Changes to the open command!  For the long history of FieryMud
      if ever there was a container and a door in the same room a
      player would always try to open the container and be frustrated
      just trying to find the door.  This how now been fixed!  If you
      state open <door_name> <direction> it will open the door.  The
      trick is stating the direction will now always ignore 
      containers and other objects.
    - The automatic reboot times of the mud, introduced to give
      players a fresh mud to hunt in from time to time, has been
      lengthened. 
    - Rumor has it, carrying capacity was tweaked a little to
      increase it.  But not for Ehlissa. 
    - Spellcasting will abort nearly instantly if the target of
      the spell disappears for some reason. 
    - Damage caused by low level sorcerous creatures (NPCs) has been 
      reduced to be inline with melee damage.  (Wait, what? oh
      man why we so nice? -Zzur)
    - Fixed "some" damage oriented spells that weren't 
      properly calculating damage.

    - The behavior of hide and sneak has changed. 
      Players, mobs, and objects now have "hide points," 
      reflecting how hidden someone or something is.  If 
      this number is lower than your perception stat, you 
      will be able to see it.  The search command will 
      remove hide points from hidden objects.  Also, if 
      you are hiding, you are now automatically sneaking. 
    - If you know the name of a hidden door, you can 
      type "search <doorname> to find it immediately.

      may quest for.

      as themselves while shapechanged. 
    - Toggles are now available while shapechanged.

      ground.  Expect some newbie items and keys to be 
      marked transient. 
    - Summon will now find the closest target to the caster. 
    - Many communication and information commands 
      will now be usable while meditating, casting, and 
      paralyzed.

      which of two objects is better than the other. 
    - We decided to stop dropping newbies into a bottomless chasm. 
    - You can set your hometown (the place word of recall takes
      you) by touching certain artifacts in Mielikki, Ickle,
