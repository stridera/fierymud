   -- Several area updates -- as follows:
  * The Theatre: 
   --The Theatre should be a bit quieter now.  Mob random chance speech 
     triggers reduced in frequency.  They've also been talking elocution 
     lessons to speak more slowly so you can catch up to what they're saying.
    --You'll no longer look like you're wearing the eyelashes of a dead 
      person.  Catherine assures us (and the world) her lashes are fake.  
      Also, they can be called "lashes" now.  And If you bring her the dressing
      room key but not her lashes, she'll ask you for another favor.
    --Charlemagne's sash is a little easier to identify from the pile of 
      other clothes that look just like it.
    --The Fire Goddess is tired of waiting for Pippin.  She's a bit more 
      explicit with her instructions.
---That is all for now
---Chinok

   *Odaishyozen:
    --Overall, did a passover to reduce Orientalist trends in the zone without 
      removing the obvious flavor of magic and furikake.
    --Names of clothes from this island have been localized to their native
      language and are much prettier to look at!
    --A few rooms have been renamed and their descriptions updated to reflect
      what they actually are in traditional arts.
    --Removed references to the people on this island being "slant-eyed" 
      because it's 2020 and even in Caelia we don't need to be describing
      people that way anymore.
    --The Goddess has gone through immigration and has accepted a new name!
      She will now be known as Kannon, Goddess of Mercy, though she 
      (and that wall) will still respond to her old name Kwan Yin.

     The reset will be worked out over the next few days.  If you find anything
     broke with the mudd, please report via MUDMAIL.  I will let everyone

     --- Thanks for your patience

*April 18, 2014
     *Fiery has been running on a 32 bit outdated server OS for about 2 years.
      We will need to update the server to a current version, 64 bit OS.
      Unfortunatly, that means some downtime to upgrade.  We are looking at the 
      weekend of April 26-27 for the upgrade. This will take us some time, but 
      NOTHING will be lost, and it should provide some performance gains  
      (less lag).  This is one of those things we must do, so just be prepared
      for it, and don't freak out when you see firey down the weekend of 
      the 26-27.

*February 1, 2014

      *Check out the website.  There's a new 'Connect NOW!' button
       at the top of the screen that will connect you to our flash
       based MUDD client.  It has support for aliases and triggers,
       but make sure you save them, as it don't keep up with them
       itself.  but you can play from work now! :)
       I'm working on a help page for the client, but I think most
       of you can figure it out.  As always, let me know if you have
       questions, forum, email, or mudmail.

      *Just in time for spring Fashions...
      All of the Phase 3 Armor quest items (but 3) have been updated,
      some major, some minor.  To help you get the newest versions 
      of these armors, as well as any other updated items 
      (like the monocle), search out Tr'ven, he has set up shop 
      in Mielikki. 
      
      *If there's a piece of quest armor you have earned, but you just
       can't tell where it ran off to, contact Ramah via mudmail, and 
       he will help you out.  Before you decide to cheat, yes, he 
       can tell if you've earned it :)

*March 29, 2013
      * Monks have been slightly tweeked.  Overall, their damange was 
      increased, but you may notice a little less damage at lower
      levels.  Let us know if	something don't look right.  Yuhen 
      wants to see monks hit 6 time per round, (at less damage 
      of course) so this tweeking might not be done just yet.

      * Trainers now have their own rooms in Mielikki, you may have to 
      search them out, but it's worth the trouble.
                ---Chinok


*March 22, 2013
      Skill trainers are now available around the town of Mielikki.
      These profesional trainers will take a few of your hard earned
      platinum, to help you increase your skills.  Of course they wont
      allow you to increase your skill past your level, but it might be
      easier than backstabbing 5000 bugs.
                --Let us know if there are any issues with them
                --Chinok

      A ranger has been added to Morgan Hill, to help save newbies
      under level 10.  We haven't had a lot of newbies to save lately,
      so I thought it important to save the ones we have.
                      --Happy Mudding

*July 20, 2012
     A few new items have been added to the website.  There is now a 
        stats page that shows who's been logged in recently.  There's 
        also the famous death counts, always fun to look at. The death
        counts are always current up to the last game reset, and the logins 
        are updated every 5 minutes. 
   --Also, NEWS that's posted here, automatically shows up on the website
        now.  So you can see game updates in both places!

     The retirement of Fierymud may have been greatly exaggerated.  
     We.re back, on a new server, and will continue to run as long
     as I can support it.  We have some new features planned that 
     I hope you will enjoy as well.  So please keep playing, and 
     remind your friends we are still here, and they should 
     come join us.

      Thank you all for playing and helping with FieryMUD over the decades
      that she has been running.  It has been immeasurebly fun over the
      years but my time for the mud has come and gone.  I have offered the
      code and parts of FieryMUD to each of the people subscribing to the
      gods email list and stated that if one of them choses to run the mud
      I would not object.  The time for my retirement has come at last.
      I've not set a date yet, but I suspect that the 28th of July will be
      the last day I host the FieryMUD systems.  If one of the gods steps
      up and claims that they want to host the mud, I'll post more detals.

      Thank you all again, and may you slay many dragons.

    o The terrain type Cave has been implemented. This should enable
      many spells that were wrongly disabled underground previously.
