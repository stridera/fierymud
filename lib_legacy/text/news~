      * Ice Cult
      	- The entrance of the area has been made less lowbee friendly,
	  to better reflect it's intended level.
      * Frost Valley

  	- A few items in this area have been upgraded to fit the 
	  difficulty level.
      * Cathedral of Betrayal
    o Abbey’s key’s are back where they aught to be.
    o The Logging Camp quest should be online now.
    o Some items in the world have been adjusted to be more appropriate

        in terms of area difficulty.

						     - Yuhen

* February 8, 2012
    o A new area has just been added bridging the Great Road and 
      Nikozian Trail: Logging Camp (15-20)
    - Logging Camp is primerily good-neutral aligned.
    - The Camp itself has some shops selling goods useful for
       lumberjacks, explorers, or those lacking is supplies otherwise
       purchased in town.
    - As a side perk, with this area in-game a previously-missing
      piece to the Hermits instructions is now available for the Rhell
      Forest quest.
    o Several objects in the world have been updated:
    - 2H weapons at all levels have been updated to produce viable
      damage.
    - Many hard-to-get items that were previously not very valuable,
      have been updated. Updated areas include:
      * Fiery Island, Griffin, Cathedral of Betrayal, Barrow.

      item level, stats and area difficulty.
						     - Yuhen

* January 25, 2012
    o A bug was fixed where backstab was performing crushing damage
      instead of piercing damage.

* January 9, 2012
    o A few items have just been updated:
      - The merchant in Rhell Forest (between twisted and blue fog) 
        now has a dynamic quest available.
      - The druids quest in Twisted Forest is back online.
      - A few fixes to Rhell Forest and Sacred Haven have been made.
                                                     - Yuhen

* January 3, 2012
    o A new area, the The Rhell Forest is out in the Twisted Forest
      and connects to Blue Fog.  Levels 45-55, I hope you all get
      killed many times.  - Zzur

* October 10, 2011
    o The limit of only having two characters on at once has been
      suspended until such time that FieryMUD has a huge player-
      base again.  Since I suspect that text based RPG's glory days
      have passed, this may well be permenant.  I hope you all find
      more enjoyment with the mud.  - Zzur

* April 3, 2011
    - New Area: Split Skull
      This area is an evil village that is set in opposition to the 
      abbey by the Black Legion.  To combat their influence the
      Eldorian court has dispatched an Emissary to the Abbey as well.
      Players 8 to 20 are encouraged to take sides in the fight.
      If you are good, go help raid the new zone!
    - Split Skull is north of the Enchanted Hollow, but beware it has
      an entrance into the Mystwatch swamps where it all seems to look
      the same.  The rangers have yet to make it over to protect that
      area.
    - I believe Split Skull is production ready, but it was so long 
      in development and so rarely worked on there may be tons of
      holes the quests and play.  Let us know what you find if stuff
      doesn't work.

* March 18, 2011
    - FieryMUD is now running on new hardware.  Technical difficulties
      may occur, but we will work hard to minimize any inconvenience.
      Thank you for your patience.

* July 2, 2010
    - Shrynn, Lord of the Air, now wields a fearsome new stick.  You
      are warned.

      in the Templar Magistrate's room northwest of the Mielikki Town 
      Fountain.

* July 17, 2009
    - The Paladin phase 3 armor quest has been moved from the Knight
      Errant to Belward in Sacred Haven.

* July 14, 2009

      challenges.  Participants will compete using new characters to 
      attempt to be named Fiery's fastest!

      participate and have fun in this quest!  See the player bulletin 
      board for rules, prizes, and more information.

* June 10, 2009
    - Prompts can now display cooldowns for various skills,
      such as lay hands, shapechange, and throatcut.  See
      &bhelp prompt&0 for a complete list or try &bdisplay 9&0 to
      see the first aid cooldown in action.
    - Clans have been completely reimplemented.  They mostly
      work the same, but the clan command should be somewhat
      easier to use.  Also, certain events are now broadcast
      to members of the clan, such as level-ups and deaths.
    - The amount of damage that breath attacks inflict has
      been decreased by about 40%.

* March 21, 2009
    - Pyromancers have new spells:
        * Detonation
        * Phosphoric embers
        * Positive field
        * Acid burst
      The spells combust and heatwave have been retired.
    - Cryomancers get the waterwalk spell in circle 1.
    - The soul tap spell now has a slow, life-draining effect.
    - Bulletin boards have received a complete makeover.  One
      note: you must now type 'write board <subject>' to post.
    - You can get a specific amount of items:

      > get 4 bread
      > get 3 gem 2.bag

* March 17, 2009
    - The 'spells' command has been improved.
    - Some objects won't fall.

* March 13, 2009
    - The detect poison spell now works more like detect magic,
      giving a person the ability to detect poison for a while.
    - First aid has been made more useful.
    - Most fluid or non-corporeal creatures won't leave behind
      a corpse when killed.
    - The exits and scan commands were tweaked a bit.

* February 4, 2009
    - After using summon mount, (Anti-)Paladins won't have to wait
      a week to summon a new one; the cooldown is now 12 hours
      since the mount is lost.
    - The guard skill now works on NPCs.
    - New emote's command lets you do stuff like:
      > emote's arms flail wildly as he falls over!
      <> Laochan's arms flail wildly as he falls over!
    - Damage amounts now visible for damage done by soulshield,
      fireshield, and coldshield.

    - Waterform has become a quest spell.

* September 10, 2008
    - Odaishyozen has been touched up a bit. See if you can find
      the new items!

* September 7, 2008
    - Equipment used to become weightless when you wore it.  Now it
      will continue to have weight.  This will disrupt some folks'
      carefully apportioned kits, so the weight limit has been increased
      accordingly.
    - Objects will now generally disappear from the game if left
      unattended for too long.  Basically, if a player handles something
      and then gets rid of it, OR if an object falls to the ground from
      a decomposing corpse, it will disappear after a while.
      Also, player corpses will take even longer to decompose.
    - When you're very close to your weight limit, you'll be too
      heavy to fly.

* August 31, 2008
    - The towns of Mielikki, Anduin, and Ickle won't tolerate evil
      pets any more, and the guards will attack them on sight.
      Necromancers especially should take care.
    - Town guards are more protective of players and will help them
      out in a fight, instead of taking the NPC's side like they used
      to do. There is an exception: if you're fighting a guard or
      other valued townsperson, the guards WILL still attack you.
    - The new toggles have been renamed ExpandObjs and ExpandMobs.

* August 30, 2008
    - The StackObjs and StackMobs toggles can now be used to control
      whether you see multiples of the same object or mobile on a
      single line when you look in a room, a container, or your inventory.
    - The 'abandon' command allows you to leave behind folks who are
      following you.

* August 24, 2008
    - Adventurers may be excited to learn that a way exists into
      Technitzitlan that doesn't involve falling. Good luck finding it.
    - NPCs won't have unlimited spells any longer.

* August 21, 2008
    - According to word of mouth, a new resort up north has opened
      its doors to the public! Phoenix Feather Hot Springs should be
      a good challenge for those of you in the 55-60 range.
    - There is no longer a damage type of "magic". The magic missile
      spell now does piercing damage. Bigby's Fist does crushing damage
      and disintegrate does acid damage.

* August 17, 2008
    - You can edit your description in the game with the 'desc' command.
    - By player suggested idea your trophy will clear when you die,
      unless you're questing. This was a good idea submitted long ago
      but we're going through them all and going to give each its due.
      Some quests require you to get a list of creatures on your trophy.
      Gods who assign quests are responsible for marking players as
      'questing' or not.

* August 16, 2008
    - A hundred or so player submitted ideas have been addressed
      and the responses are in the forums.  These ideas span all
      the way back to the first week this current version of the
      code was active.

* August 12, 2008
    - Some sorcerer single-target attack spells were recalibrated.
    - NPCs are affected by laryngitis.  This sad affliction has
      descended upon them due to the corruption of the Necromancer
      class by nefarious agents.

* August 10, 2008
    - Due to insufficient demand, the weapon slinging feature has
      been retired.
    - The operation of the sense life spell has changed. Our
      long-time players may recognize its behavior being very close
      to the original spell. In keeping with the concept of life
      forces, it now depends on the susceptibility to healing magic.
      As a result, purely magical creatures cannot be sensed with
      this spell.
    - Heatwave and Cone of Cold was fixed.  You'll have to discover
      that that means.

* April 17, 2008
    - Hitroll and Armor Class points are now individually significant.
      Previously, you had to roll over the 10s digit to gain any
      benifit - for example, 19 was no better than 10.  Now every
      point counts.

* April 12, 2008
    - The AUTOTREAS toggle can be used to merely loot treasure,
      such as coins and gems, from your kills.

* April 4, 2008
    - The split command now randomly chooses who gets
      the 'leftovers'.
    - There are two new toggles: autoloot and autosplit.
      See HELP AUTOLOOT and HELP AUTOSPLIT.
    - The movement point cost for using the disarm skill
      has been changed.
    - Bashed mobs will stay down a bit longer.

* March 28, 2008
    - When you are in a fluid state due to the Waterform or
      Vaporform spell, you won't be able to pick up or accept
      objects.
    - Creatures are resistant to various types of damage
      according to their composition.  For example, ice creatures
      will be immune to cold, but vulnerable to crushing. See
      HELP COMPOSITION for more information.
    - Creatures are also vulnerable to certain attacks according
      to their life force.  See HELP LIFE FORCE for more
      information.
    - Spectres, ghosts, and other creatures with no physical
      form are generally invulnerable to physical attacks.
      However, the bless and dark presence spells can help
      fighters destroy these beings.  See HELP BLESS and
      HELP DARK PRESENCE.
    - The above changes represent a major change to Fiery's
      combat system, so rebalancing is likely.  Please use the
      BUG or PETITION commands if you see any inconsistencies
      or imablances.

* March 11, 2008
    - With the NoClanTell toggle, you can suppress messages from your
      clan channel.

* February 11, 2008
    - There's a new toggle: nohint.  You can use it to choose whether
      to get the names of similar commands when you enter a typo or
      nonexistent command.
    - Did you know that most of the subclass quests were broken?
      Well, they got fixed.
    - Hide was acting up too. It got fixed.
    - Deities will be able to "hotboot" the mud so that it restarts
      without disconnecting everyone.  Other than that, it will be
      like a normal reboot.

* February 5, 2008
    - Scavenger mobs have been fixed.
    - Players can now be assigned several titles for their good
      (or nefarious) deeds. You can choose which of your titles to
      display at any time.

* January 26, 2008
    - Area Updates:
	o A couple of the Eldoria quests were repaired.
	o A large number of phase armor quests that were broken should
	  be functional now.  Post in the forums if they are not.
	o Princess Signess shouldn't hide anymore.

* January 21, 2008
    - You can drag incapacitated players who have consented you.
    - Spellcasters won't receive skills they can't use.
    - Observations made using infravision are more detailed.
    - The "attributes" command now shows unmodified HP and MV.
    - Quite a number of scripts and quests have been updated to take
      advantage of some code improvements.  Let us know if any of
      them cease working.
    - Some mobs (like assassin and warriors) will now fight back using
      various skills, like kick and hitall.  Look out for thieves with loose
      hands too.  Also, spellcasters will now cast spells more specific to
      their class too.
    - The exp bar will now appear on your score, and also displays your
      progress to the next level with greater precision.  The * shows
      your overall progress towards the next level, and the = marks
      show your progress between * gradations.
    - You can use the 'aggr' command to make yourself aggressive, and
      to preemptively attack mobiles that would attack you. 

* December 25, 2007
    - Merry Christmas!! and a Ho Ho Ho!!
    - There was a bug that prevented says from being seen by other 
      players in the room with you.  This has been fixed.
    - Some bug associated with fly has been fixed.
    - There was an error in weight calculations that allowed players
      carrying so much weight they would be crushed to be able to move
      around still.. fixed!
    - The armor bug has been fixed and should actually help your AC
      instead of making it worse.

* December 24, 2007
    - Merry Christmas!!
    - Clans have been redesigned from scratch, and should eliminate
      some of the previously experienced bugs.  Some snazzy new
      features have been introduced with the new design, including
      descriptions, alts, and the ability to enroll, promote, demote,
      or expel someone when they aren't even online!  See 'help clan'
      for more info.
    - The score command now almost always shows the numbers behind the
      descriptive text, even for newbies.  Some of the descriptive
      messages have changed to be shorter (current load) or more
      accurate (exp progress).  Some of these changes also affect the
      attributes command.
    - Several new command codes are available for prompt, including
      hiddenness, alignment, your name, exp, and active spells!  See
      'help prompt' for descriptions of each code.
    - Or if you're too lazy to figure that all out, try one of the
      two new preset displays (just type 'display' to see them).
      They show alignment, hiddenness, exp to the next level, and
      active spells.  

* December 10, 2007
    - Transient objects should behave better once picked up. 
    - Numerous long standing crash bugs fixed. 
    - Instakill will now have a chance to improve skill on failure. 
    - Steal will have a slightly better chance of success if hidden. 
    - Changes to the open command!  For the long history of FieryMud
      if ever there was a container and a door in the same room a
      player would always try to open the container and be frustrated
      just trying to find the door.  This how now been fixed!  If you
      state open <door_name> <direction> it will open the door.  The
      trick is stating the direction will now always ignore 
      containers and other objects.
    - The automatic reboot times of the mud, introduced to give
      players a fresh mud to hunt in from time to time, has been
      lengthened. 
    - Rumor has it, carrying capacity was tweaked a little to
      increase it.  But not for Ehlissa. 
    - Spellcasting will abort nearly instantly if the target of
      the spell disappears for some reason. 
    - Damage caused by low level sorcerous creatures (NPCs) has been 
      reduced to be inline with melee damage.  (Wait, what? oh
      man why we so nice? -Zzur)
    - Fixed "some" damage oriented spells that weren't 
      properly calculating damage. 

* October 25, 2007
    - The behavior of hide and sneak has changed. 
      Players, mobs, and objects now have "hide points," 
      reflecting how hidden someone or something is.  If 
      this number is lower than your perception stat, you 
      will be able to see it.  The search command will 
      remove hide points from hidden objects.  Also, if 
      you are hiding, you are now automatically sneaking. 
    - If you know the name of a hidden door, you can 
      type "search <doorname> to find it immediately. 
    - Monks have some new chants, three of which you 
      may quest for. 
    - Druids will no longer be randomly kicked out of their 
      shapechanges, but will return to their normal form if 
      idle for too long. 
    - Druids can now be able to use OOC communication 
      as themselves while shapechanged. 
    - Toggles are now available while shapechanged. 
    - Instead of crumbling when you remove them, 
      "transient" items will now crumble when left on the 
      ground.  Expect some newbie items and keys to be 
      marked transient. 
    - Summon will now find the closest target to the caster. 
    - Many communication and information commands 
      will now be usable while meditating, casting, and 
      paralyzed. 
    - The compare command can be used to help decide 
      which of two objects is better than the other. 
    - We decided to stop dropping newbies into a bottomless chasm. 
    - You can set your hometown (the place word of recall takes
      you) by touching certain artifacts in Mielikki, Ickle, 
      Anduin, and Ogakh.

* September 15, 2007
    - We've moved a few of our newbie areas nearer to 
      the Forest Village of Mielikki.
    - The rent limit has been abolished, although 
      carrying capacity for some of our stronger 
      characters has been lowered.
    - Single-target attack spells for Sorcerers, 
      Pyromancers, and Cryomancers have been beefed up. 
    - Thieves get double attack at level 75, and 
      mercenaries get dual wield at level 15. 
    - Thieves have a new ability: identify. Well 
      actually everyone has it, but only thieves are 
      any good at it.
    - Druids can now specify an animal job to shapechange into: 
      tank, damager, tracker, or travel.  Additionally, there is 
      now a set of fish species available when in the water. 
      See help shapechange for more information. 
    - Invigorate is now a group spell. 
    - Farsee now helps you scan farther. 
    - Natures embrace now allows druids to freely move around 
      outdoors while still hidden from view. 

* August 20, 2007
    - The abort command will allow you to prematurely 
      end a spell cast. 
    - Circle of fire will now do damage both on the way 
      into and out of a room, as the helpfile reports. 
    - A stadium-style PK arena is now open at the 
      Festival Grounds in Upper Anduin.  Yes, you read 
      that correctly. 
    - The locate object spell is back.  All sorcerer 
      classes receive it.  Wands and scrolls of locate 
      object may also be found across the realm. 
    - Skilled warriors and mercenaries can carefully 
      concert their combat movements to control their 
      escape from battle using the retreat skill. Mercenaries 
      can direct an orderly retreat of an entire group using 
      group retreat. 
    - Monks may now train to springleap their opponents, 
      potentially knocking them over. 
    - Especially skilled rogues and monks can corner their 
      opponents, preventing them from fleeing. 
    - With a little bit of effort, industrious rogues and 
      thieves can conceal items in the room.  They may 
      also be able to conceal their interactions with items 
      through the stow and palm commands. 
    - Rogues and assassins have the ability to discretely 
      follow their targets, shadowing their movements. 
    - Skilled rogues and thieves may reach new levels 
      of sneakiness with the stealth skill. 
    - Druids have a new spell, moonbeam, in circle 3.
    - We have new socials: flanic, glomp, mumble, twitch,
      beckon, and glower.
    - Many creatures across the realm have received their 
      due elemental immunities. Fire won't harm fire 
      elementals, cold won't hurt ice golems, and so forth.
    - Excessive talking, gossiping, and other communicating
      will result in laryngitis.

* July 29, 2007
    - Mounts are now available to all levels - just
      don't expect to be able to control anything 
      particularly powerful at level 1. 
    - Pets, including purchased and summoned 
      mounts, will leave the game when their master
      attacks them or leaves the game.
