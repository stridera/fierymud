   &0&3&bo&0 Wiki and website upgraded and fixed... (php upgrades took it down)  

   &0&3&bo&0 Immortals can now cast self-only spells on anybody.

   &0&3&bo&0 'show rent' now supports stacking of objects. It also displays
     equipped items correctly.

   &0&3&bo&0 The grant system is working.

   &0&3&bo&0 iedit should be working too.

 &0&6&b November 17 2007 - Rift and Halflife on &3&bNEW&0 &6&bhardware!!&0

   &0&3&bo&0 Please check things to make sure you have all your data and 
     things function as expected.

   &0&3&bo&0 So far the only potential issue I've noticed is that the NFS
     mount of the development directories between the boxes didn't
     seem to behave in an automated fashion.  They are up now but
     I'm not sure how well they'd recover in a reboot.

   &0&3&bo&0 Additionally, rift will not reboot, if it goes down currently
     I'll need to drive in and press the power button. Halflife
     will spottily reboot cleanly, sometimes I need to hit f1 to
     continue to boot, sometimes I don't, almond joy has nuts,
     rift don't.

   &0&3&bo&0 I think all the packages necessary to develop are installed
     on halflife, and all files necessary for our existance are
     in place.

   &0&3&bo&0 Check out the new look to Doxygen on rift.  Since you guys
     had to have it :P  I'm not sure if it offers any additional
     functionality but I'm sure as coders you will be able to tell.

   &0&3&bo&0 Be sure to add yourself to the iptables on rift.  Once you
     do you can jump from rift to halflife build yourself a dev
     mud there then boot it up to add yourself to the iptables
     on hafllife so you no longer have to jump through rift.

   &0&3&bo&0 Generally, I'd like to know sooner than later if we're
     going to develop issues.  I know I've completely lost my
     mind, but I'm going to look at bios and microcode upgrades
     for the boxes in the coming months.  If they fry I'm going
     to just cry.

   &0&3&bo&0 Insure++ is gone for good now I think.  I hope there
     are other memory checking tools we can make use of.

   &0&3&bo&0 As mentioned in another post the ssh keys are now different
     for rift so the cross site backups probably need close
     inspection and perhaps rework.

   &0&3&bo&0 Pending a production build to v204 do not use iptalbes on
     production.  Use it on test if you need to pending moves back to 
     halflife.  Build 204 and after iptables can be used on production.

   &0&3&bo&0 Er....so I've been slave driving snobol and got him to fix
     the little screw up with the dragon breath messages. Now that the fix
     is in i've added a couple of triggers to a bunch of the different
     dragons. They should now breath something appropriate to themselves,
     or at least how i pictured it, aswell as sweep and roar in combat.

   &0&3&bo&0 Yup another update, someone is actually working looks like!
     Two new commands have been added to the arsenal of the little higher
     Gods. Pain and Rpain is added for L103+ it works like restore and
     rrestore but in this case will remove 10% of the the persons current
     HP and MV.

   &0&3&bo&0 ANEWS Update, shocking again.&0
   &0&3&bo&0 After a meeting between Acerite, Ferik, Pergus, and Tanle,
     we have decided to modify the RULES of FieryMUD and implement a
     few changes in that vein.  See the new help rules.
   &0&3&bo&0 I have also added a new help topic.  'Help punishment' has
     been designed, again by the four of us, as a set of rules governing
     player justice.  These are the laws which deities are to use when
     dealing with violations of the revised rules.  Please abide by them
     and leave NOTES on the players!

   &0&3&bo&0 Well don't freaking faint, there's an ANEWS update.&0
   &0&3&bo&0 The save command was removed from the mortals due to equipment
     duplication abuse.  The command is now level 101.  Do NOT tell
     any mortal the command still exists.  Thanks to the assistance
     of Acerite there is now a save all option that will kick off 
     an autosave for the entire realm.  Use this instead of the one
     great command of force all save <silly message here>.  Yes I 
     will miss doing that.

   * Show file has been fixed. It will now take a numeric argument. Currently
     500 is the limit. -Zantir
   * Players should not be able to create Shamans anymore. -Zantir
   * Two useful commands have been added. Vwear and Vitem. Read the help on
     them to find out more. - Zantir
   * As mentioned in the player news innates have been fixed. All existing
     Barbarians will need to have their race reset. Please verify that the person
     is a barbarian before fulfilling their request. Use set race to do this.
     -Zantir
   * Also the AGGR flags have been changed so that mobs do not attack each
     other. If someone can come up with a case where a mob needs to attack a mob,
     please talk to me. So please start using the AGGR flags again. -Zantir
   * A new room flag has been added, ALWAYSLIT. The name explains it all.
     -Zantir
   * Yes, OOC references have disappeared. If the mortals don't figure out,
     don't tell them. -Zantir
   * See the mortal news for other stuff, but this mostly covers it.  Help
     files updated some

    Well, it's been for freaking ever since we've had a produciton update
   but man was this due.  There were seriously 150 revisions to the code
   for this update, insane.  At least 60 of them were me doing grunt admin
   work on the files addind the proper comment header and missing rlog
   messages.
    All I can say is Nardok WENT OFF on the quest code guys, it really
  rocks.  The subclass quests are still outstanding to be polished off and
  moved to production but the code to allow builders to implement quests
  online is in place.  Oh and before you builders think about adding a
  quest to give someone extra skills and spells, only a level 104 can
  actually save a trigger that alters a players stats.  Nardok still has
  a great deal of documentation he's dreading to complete.  I'll wait
  with enthusiam on it.  We may even get the gods web server back up to
  house all this documentation within the next week or so, I hope at least.

   To detail some of the changes:
	There is now an ask/whisper trigger! - So you can hinde your quest
          keywords from silly players.  I suggest anyone who has a speech
	  trigger on a quest alter it to be an ASK trigger.
	Added color to the who list for gods to see name approval
 	  states for unapproved frozen and declined players when typing who
	Players who have their names declined at login will now just SIT
          at the newname prompt until they chose a new name as opposed to
          getting into the game like before.
	Stat will now show player quest info.
	Debug was added to the boot messages to track down those freaking
          errant boards.
	Debug was added to the boot messages to track down those freaking
          bad spell/skill level entries.
 	The makefile has a supahclean option to wax all .o .c and .h files,
          guys this is serious don't make supahclean unless you mean it.
	Tlist is now somewhat fixed and will list all triggers in a zone
          within the same 100 vnum boundry.
        Triggers will no longer kick off while a mobile is casting!
	That forking redit_save_internally error message now has some extra
          info in it to help track down where the error is.

   While Nardok was in prelimenary testing of the new trigger quest code
  it was discovered that some bogus information was being passed between
  functions causing crashes.  Well, it turns out Nardok borrowed the frame-
  work for the function from the real_room() function so since a great deal
  of our ancient crashes have always been real_room() related, Gurlaek has
  added debug to attempt to ferret out what could be our oldest known crash
  bug.  Between this and Nardok finding the sling_weapon crash bug and fixing
  it, we could be up for some steallar uptimes *knocks on wood*.
   OLC as you wanna be:  Mobs should now be able to be any class a player
  can be.  MOB progs have been removed.  There are no progs on test any-
  more.  Tanle and I removed the 409 of them on test and converted them all
  to TRIGGERS.  Aaiiieiiieeeee.  Choice P isn't even in medit anymore. All
  the mobprogs will be gone whena Tanle has me move areas to production
  later this month early next month. Also, there should only be a max of
  about 50 objects or mobiles of any one kind loaded into the game. While
  tracking some debug down in the zone sfiles imagine my horror to discover
  that some zone files have a maximum of 234874637323 objects to possibly
  load!  ACK, guys this represents a huge number in memory and really is
  unacceptable.  I'll work with someone to get sane numbers in those fields.
   CORPSE TRACKING - 'My corpse disappeared :( or it's still there and no
  eq is inside it :('  Well no more mortals lieing about this!  Each time a
  players corpse decomposes, is moved from one room to another, or everytime
  an item is taken from a player corpse IT WILL BE LOGGED and should be 
  parsed into the rip log along with players deaths.  Check it.

    Due to popular demand the purge command has been fixed so as
   not to purge items that are NO_TAKE.  Note this applies to items
   that are no_take only, any other wear flags won't apply.
    Set is available again and the subcommands have some sanity now.
    Show players will show a players level in addition to their name
   approval state now.
    Avatars no longer idle out.
