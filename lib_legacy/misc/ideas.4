Yath     (Sep 17) [ 6225] shazz should be able to see invis
Meina    (Dec 12) [ 8174] since you can check what skills you have available while sleeping, perhaps you should be able to check spells too :)
Meina    (Dec 12) [ 8048] Informational commands aimed at the player probably shouldn't be dependent on the status of the character.  For instance, the level command should not interrupt meditate.
Meina    (Dec 12) [ 8123] Reading help files should probably not interrupt meditate.
Meina    (Dec 13) [ 3005] Tells should probably not interrupt meditation.

Meina    (Dec 13) [ 3003] All the skills and spells that cause mandatory lag really hurt the social aspect.  Perhaps they can lag only other spells/commands for combat, but not pure communication channels?
Meina    (Dec 13) [ 8024] casting timered spells, like armor, should probably reset the timer on the spell instead of being frfutless if the target already has it.

Meina    (Dec 15) [ 3009] Instead of random rolling for stats, some games have gone the route of giving players points they can allocate to any stat they want, at an increasing rate the higher the stat goes (ie to raise it to level 1 might take 1 point, but to raise to level 
Meina    (Dec 15) [ 3009] Continued from above - (ie to raise it to level 1 might take 1 point, but to raise to level 10 might take 50 points).  It alleviates whining and complaining about randomized stats.
Meina    (Dec 15) [17200] Allow players to interrupt spells they are casting.
Jalor    (Dec 16) [51000] why not change moonwell so that it's not a gate anymore...seriously, it's a pain in the ass
Nauis    (Dec 16) [ 3005] Bring back the semi-colon as gtell like the apostrophe works for say.
Nauis    (Dec 17) [10035] Bring back yummy packets of food please! So yummy!
Meina    (Dec 18) [46439] Mobs shouldn't drop items higher than the level of the people intended to be there.  Aka Ickle Aviary Alexandra's Parrot drops winged cloak that level 11s can't use but the zone is for 3-8.
Meina    (Dec 18) [ 6916] Would be cool to put a description on the altar here.
