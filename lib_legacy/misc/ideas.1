Raditz   (Mar 25) [ 3002] assassins and hunters should be able to kill especially since assassins are evil.  they should get paid for their deads by being hired by someone to kill someone/thing else.  This would help a great deal in role=playing.  what better role-playing is 
Raditz   (Mar 25) [ 3002] assassins mercenaries and hunters should be able to kill especially since assassins are evil.  they should get paid for their deads by being hired by someone to kill someone/thing else.  This would help a great deal in role=playing. :)
Flinx    (Mar 27) [17281] An idea to ease confusion. If you want to add a spell to the spell circle, have the character go to the guild and "Learn armor", it is more real, anndit will cut down on the confusion. By the way I love this game;)

Jaciera  (May  9) [ 3007] shouldn't player position flag be Mounted when mounted on object and certian actions cannot go off
Jaciera  (May 13) [ 3054] shouldn't 'negate cold' be native to a cryomancer without casting a spell for it, that would be a better spell on a pryomancer and the reverse like negate fire would be on a cryomancer
Borag    (May 14) [55712] i noticed rance has the title wyvernkill...presumably from a quest, wouldnt 'wyvernbane' be better?
