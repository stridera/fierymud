Raul     (Dec 15) [ 3054] considering that Paladins are "rarely seen without their mounts" wouldn't it be closer to the description of a paladin to give him/her more power with their mount other than fighting.  Maybe move points go up when riding or tame.
Raul     (Dec 15) [ 3010] I just realized that movepoints don't really exsist with the mounts for Paladins...  But, here is one thing, when you get two mounts in the same room, only one person can control their mount... the other person and his mount have to either leave or wai

Kur      (Jan  3) [16032] i played in a mud that added 25% to total xp earned from mob for every member in group.  Right now grouping seems to really slow down xp earned, and the fighting doesn't seem to go much faster
Ment     (Jan  4) [ 3054] bring back the PLAYER'S board again now that we have a use for it.
Manx     (Jan  5) [ 5166] maybe saving throws could get better with levels ( such as a level 50 warrior not being poor at all of them) :) - Manx

Grintod  (Jan 14) [17229] what about making some mobs really fast movers?  like you need to attack them when they are in your room, which may only be as long as 5 seconds or something?  does present code allow for that?
Grintod  (Jan 14) [17200] how about the ability to tap corpses?  will this ever be back?
Jyt      (Jan 14) [ 2501] Stone skin seems worthless when you have it cast on you and detect magic says "fading" already for it, just after it was cast on me.  It barely lasts any time at all

Ecaplic  (Jan 18) [16006] I think it is stupid to eat food when it says you are hungry, then for the sake of doing it at the same time, drink water, but have the drinking say you are too full.  Then 20 seconds later have it say I am thirsty

Tanle    (Jan 20) [58513] mobs that cast spells primarily should have a round of melee attack before they attack so that you do not just see that this big ass mob is casting a spell at you and change rooms
Sorn     (Jan 21) [ 5014] bring back corpse tapping!
Sorn     (Jan 21) [ 5022] put s'more mobs in misty caverns, it's kinda sparse
Riengale (Jan 22) [ 3002] tells that can go 2-way like a tel riengale/silvingale whats up... would work well for players w/2 chars lvling or something, just a thought :)
Grintod  (Jan 22) [ 2007] how hard would it be to add a 'rage' feature, such that when a mob or char gets dangerously low in hp, they may do more damage?  i would hink that this should happen infrequently, but hey, it's an idea.
Rein     (Jan 22) [ 3054] put in the old magic system.  this new one is pathetic.
Tanle    (Jan 22) [ 1222] A spell much like relocate that can summon someone/something from anywhere on the mud.
Ysmariad (Jan 22) [ 8046] how about a skill called Prey:  you type Prey "mob", and it marks them as yours alone, for some predetermined period of time.  It also makes the mob aware you'll be attacking soon

Sorn     (Jan 26) [16925] Idea: bad joke channel
Jyt      (Jan 26) [16067] When a mob slings their weapon in an ajacent room, it should signal to helper/assisting mobs that there is a fight they need to go help with.
Sorn     (Jan 27) [ 3088] Mail, it'd be nice to be able to CC stuff to other players
Sorn     (Jan 27) [ 3009] weather is annoying, useless spam, we should be able to toggle it off
Sorn     (Jan 28) [ 3054] change the blobs, they're stockish
Ecaplic  (Jan 28) [16018] Bigby's clenched fist should act like bash and put the mobs on their butt.  I think a 3'x5' fist hitting any creature I could think up would knock it over
Jyt      (Jan 28) [16052] Typing in save should not disrupt meditation, as gossip also should not
Ailen    (Feb  1) [ 3009] You would think a "half-elven guard in full armor" would actually have some when you look at him
Rein     (Feb  2) [ 3002] for a mud based on realism, you should be able to pick up corpses no matter what, not being able to by some magical force seems reather unreal
Jactam   (Feb  3) [17882] how about a spell for mages to allow the recharging of staves, wands, and rods
Dalendar (Feb  3) [ 3022] faint   put faint in
Jactam   (Feb  4) [55466] how about some elk meat here
Nevd     (Feb  6) [ 1218] 'linkdead' command, so i can find mortals to switch into...:)
Jactam   (Feb 11) [ 5244] how about soulshield lasting till the end of ONE combat
Kediesh  (Feb 13) [16907] make it si that a mortal can preset a direction it will flee in (if possible)-great in some areas where the mobs have some locations the mortal would seek to avoid
Kediesh  (Feb 13) [16908] in 'End Of Hallway' in the haunted house, a winsow is mentioned. when one tries to open it, 'There doesn't seem to be a window here.' suggestion: for that room make a specified response (along the lines of 'The window frame is so warped, you can't bu
Kediesh  (Feb 13) [16908] continued re window: '...can't budge it.', or remove window from desc, or use window to even connect to another area rather than making of it a dead end?
Pastai   (Feb 13) [ 3001] staffs that can recharge? crystal wand thats burnt out..cast blind at the staff and its good again.
Pastai   (Feb 13) [17200] quest wands/staffs with spells like magic missile that never run out..high lvl questds
Tamiery  (Feb 13) [ 8824] some veggie's in the garden as food

Jactam   (Feb 14) [ 3009] wouldnt one find milk (in bottles) on a dairy farm?
Pastai   (Feb 14) [16046] monks need rescue, doesnt make sense that they shouldnt have it
Jactam   (Feb 15) [ 7340] chain lightning should do more damage
Tamiery  (Feb 15) [ 7340] soulshield needs a respectable duration
Jactam   (Feb 15) [ 7450] it would be nice if flamestrike would ever hit a target
Elb      (Feb 15) [ 3548] key commands such as stand while the charater is sleeping should automatically wake the character and place them in the standing position.  Also mediate should automatically envoke the rest command...it's pretty intuitive.
Elb      (Feb 15) [ 3548] the flee command shold only be 'enabled' if the character is in battle.
Omsell   (Feb 16) [ 8807] a blob, janitor or something in the Milk Pasture area
Omsell   (Feb 16) [ 8808] A help item for Gold (Help Gold) Like what the conversions are between the diffrent types. IE 10 silver=1 Gold
Grintod  (Feb 18) [17232] is it possible to give a numeric value of how much exp we have?
Grintod  (Feb 20) [16900] you know when it say 'you gain your share of experience?'  it would be cool if it said something like 'you got a ton of experience,' or 'you barely got any experience.'
Sorn     (Feb 22) [ 3002] People who get gossip disabled should be credited for their work! (Ie: You can't gossip now, thanks to Sorn!)

Jactam   (Feb 23) [48167] put dwarrow children in here to make the rooms description fit
Pastai   (Feb 25) [18501] compare skill..lets you compare two items and tells ya whats better, appraise skill for thieves would be nice
Pastai   (Feb 25) [16362] the higher level you are the better mount you can have, like ** ants riding around on flying dragons
Pastai   (Feb 25) [16335] put vampiric touch in, that would be swell
Pastai   (Feb 25) [16334] ** spellcasters should be able to cast with the wave of a hand, the whole *** thing should be done away with
Pastai   (Feb 25) [16334] immortal should be an actual level like **s, except pretty hard to achieve. immortal quest, god approval etc..no god commands or anything, just impossible for em to die
Pastai   (Feb 25) [16361] put poison back in
Pastai   (Feb 25) [16352] bring back ticks, that would be fun
Jyt      (Feb 25) [ 3054] When someone rents their wielded secondary weapon, and or 2h weapon is removed from their hands when unrented, yet things like shields remain on hands after rented.  I think secondary weapons and 2h should remain in place when unrenting
Pastai   (Feb 25) [ 3054] open door xxx  without searching, if your opening it you obviously know it's there
Pastai   (Feb 25) [ 3054] teleport global, local teleport has just become an easy way to get to eq
Jactam   (Feb 26) [ 5278] this should go somewhere
Jactam   (Feb 27) [36319] it is really annoying to be fighting one critter, and he dies betwwen rounds

Dewic    (Feb 28) [17200] sword

Kitra    (Mar  4) [16067] Death should clear one's trophy list
Puzo     (Mar  4) [ 7314] Monk + bash = makes sense.  For someone so good with their hands it would seem that monks are missing something that should come naturally to them
Dewic    (Mar  5) [17200] flask
Dewic    (Mar  5) [17200] glowing sword

Puzo     (Mar 18) [47037] Monk skill, similar to kick, except Punch!
Samhain  (Mar 18) [ 3046] make the alias system work with arguments. I wasted spells and time not realizing it doesn't work well.
Samhain  (Mar 18) [ 3046] Add DECENT help to minor creation so we know what can be created. So far, nothing seems to be creatable.
Jyt      (Mar 20) [ 5256] When riposting, or having a mob ripost you, you should have another roll to see if somehow you dodge/parry/ripost the initial ripost
Marik    (Mar 22) [ 3016] some of the spells could use a bit more descriptive juice..."the mob grabs you, causing only light wounds."  is really boring and bland
Pastai   (Mar 23) [47253] an abort command for spells..so if stone runs out on tank and mage has a 5* haste they can stop and stone
Rein     (Mar 25) [ 3001] i think the trophy list is a wee bit to long.  atleast for newbies it is.  i think it should go up at higher levels and be lower at lower levels, that'd be slick
Calim    (Mar 25) [16929] boots
Jyt      (Mar 26) [18601] Help files are absent for attributes (str, wis, dex etc).  They should be there and explain the benefits of each
Puzo     (Mar 26) [16006] Help file for monk songs and what level they get what
Puzo     (Mar 27) [ 5209] A skill (monk oriented) that is basically taking a hit.  Sure the mob hits you, but as the skill improves, their hits do less and less damage because you know how/where to be hit

Nettel   (Mar 31) [ 3054] metl
Nettel   (Apr  1) [16911] knife
Nettel   (Apr  1) [16915] ring
Jyt      (Apr  1) [ 5268] I think det invis should last longer like it used to at peak proficiency... it is running out very quickly and there is no need
Jyt      (Apr  1) [ 5268] Same with fly...
Muriz    (Apr  2) [17200] Implement a way to STOP casting a spell once you've begun. Gotten me killed bunches of times when it's not neccesary. as for the role playing aspect, it shouldn't be a bother because casters automatically stop casting if something leaves the room or 
Zirum    (Apr  5) [18023] You should be able to read the help files without having to cease meditation.
Zirum    (Apr  5) [18023] and on that note, same for submitting ideas to the idea box ;)

Ecaplic  (Apr  8) [ 3054] When renting, do not have it unwield your secondary or 2h weapon for when you unrent.  It does not unwear shields and stuff, so it should likewise not unwield your secondary.
