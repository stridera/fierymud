Dakhod   (Oct 01 2018) [ 1270] we should have a new pet in the pet store. it should be a yoshi, you know the green dinosaur from mario

Meina    (Jun 19 2019) [ 8358] bring back where to help newbies (and returning old timers) understand where they are in the world. Even if lwho needs to stay gone, knowing what general area you are in is friendlier for returning players who may get frustrated and log off if they a
Mejna    (Jun 20 2019) [ 3105] To help newbies understand better how to get better gear, maybe the guildmasters can provide more hints about where to get the gems and armor parts for quest gear at lower levels.
Mejna    (Jun 20 2019) [ 3109] Enable players to catch up on conversations missed while in battle by having some kind of history of chat. IE user types 'gos' and gets the last 5-10 gossips, 'gt' and gets last few group chats.
Meina    (Jun 21 2019) [ 8021] I like that the Ash Drakling flew away because I'm too big. Thanks!
Meina    (Jun 21 2019) [ 3036] enable the jeweler to cut gems into different shapes/states - for instance a crushed gem could be turned into dust, and an uncut into some special shape with possible dust and crushed as side effects. For a price of course!
Meina    (Jun 21 2019) [ 3036] Similar to the armor quests, having shopkeepers be able to make 'custom' (but not really truly custom, just by recipe) items if you bring all the components and pay for it could be neat too. Like bring various gems and metals to the jeweler and she c
Meina    (Jun 21 2019) [ 7098] Similar to paladin, a subclass that combined magic use and warrior would be nifty. Not nature magic, but arcane spellbook stuff. Kind of like champion for DAoC.
Meina    (Jun 22 2019) [55960] A Path in the Foothills here used to linked to Enchanted Hollow. Now that it has moved, maybe these should be normal Eldorian Foothills rooms instead or explicitly dead-end.
Meina    (Jun 22 2019) [55720] Hot spring description says it is large enough to bathe in... maybe enable 'enter spring' to let the player take a nice dip in the hot water and relax.
Meina    (Jun 22 2019) [55306] add Black Woods and Kaaz Plans to the zone list.
Meina    (Jun 22 2019) [55306] Add Black Lake to zone list.

Meina    (Jun 22 2019) [10029] Karr's Pub has great beverages, but perhaps some food offering would drum up more business - specifically yummy packets of food.
Mejna    (Jun 23 2019) [36002] an archery skill for rangers - quest skill with different levels, all bows quest items.
Meina    (Jun 24 2019) [ 5583] Make Combat in Eldoria pk - maybe some of the time or all of the time!
Mejna    (Jun 24 2019) [55307] I'd like to try taming buffalo and riding them as a ranger!
Gennaire (Jun 25 2019) [17264] add number of deaths to score
Mejna    (Jun 26 2019) [ 3054] Allow socials to interact with items. For instance, crying over a corpse, licking a piece of candy, hugging your favorite armor, etc.
Gizelle  (Jun 26 2019) [ 3009] add a help file for encumbrance so it is easier for players to understand the consequences
Gennaire (Jun 27 2019) [12015] Quest log so you can see what quests you have completed. Optionally useful to know how many times you have done a repeatable quest. Extra useful bit if it included active quests and the step you were on.
Mejna    (Jun 30 2019) [ 3032] Some kind of interaction when giving coins to beggars.
Meina    (Jun 30 2019) [ 3549] Keychain item - storage container that ONLY can hold keys, but can be deposited at a bank like a safe deposit box.
Mejna    (Jul 08 2019) [55654] Bring back evil dwarves here in Iron Hills, to go with the ancient one, and add a separate good dwarf zone. Can be a complete mirror image - just miss killing duegars all over here.
Meina    (Jul 08 2019) [10053] Anduin Pastures moved from near Anduin to closer to Mielikki, but it still seems a bit awkward there and has some world space collision with Combat in Eldoria.
Meina    (Jul 08 2019) [17894] Add a description so if you do 'look boulder' you see something instead of 'you do not see that here'.
Meina    (Jul 08 2019) [17892] Light Forest Path is probably a find name here, but since we have a very specific Light Forest Path just east of Mielikki, a different name can add depth to experience.
Mejna    (Jul 08 2019) [17867] Give the river in Canyon a name. In world lore, it seems like it drains into the northern swamps based on location.
Gennaire (Jul 08 2019) [17867] If you are on water that requires float or boat, and you try to drink it or fill a drink container, it should always be allowed. If the water is not potable, you should suffer the consequences (like salty sea water, or brackish lake water).
Meina    (Jul 08 2019) [17839] It seems odd that the move says 'swims in' when on water that requires boat. Maybe paddles in would be better.
Mejna    (Jul 10 2019) [ 8711] dwarven war axe quest item could use a little description.
Meina    (Jul 10 2019) [ 8713] Add a place to get food and/or food drops in Logging Camp.  All these lumberjacks are bound to be hungry and need food!
Mejna    (Jul 10 2019) [ 8713] Add place to get food in Logging Camp.  All thtrack meina
Mejna    (Jul 10 2019) [ 8713] oops. sorry.
Mejna    (Jul 11 2019) [ 1800] The room name and the description here don't seem to go together - plains by definition don't have massive forests blocking the way.
Meina    (Jul 12 2019) [ 3054] add facepalm social
Meina    (Jul 12 2019) [ 3054] high level quest only spell: thornshield, available for druids and rangers, and is similar to barkskin but also deals damage
Mejna    (Jul 13 2019) [ 3044] Less coin on mobs (especially ones where coin doesn't make sense), and more opportunity to sell items in towns to make money. Win-win for RP and making CHA important even at low levels.
Meina    (Jul 13 2019) [ 3044] To shush the folks who complain about mobs having items/armor in description but not actually worn, have them wear the armor but upon death have the armor/item decay/be ruined so that the same drop rate as before applies to getting the actual item.
Gizelle  (Jul 13 2019) [ 3002] identify on weapons should include damage type
Gizelle  (Jul 13 2019) [ 3002] check all !sorc items and see if they need !pyro, !cryo and !necro added for consistency
Meina    (Jul 13 2019) [ 3002] Slightly reconfigure the way Split Skull and Enchanted Forest connect for less world map collisions: from current Silent Wood add 3 more rooms going west (silent wood/mangrove forest), then a mangrove swamp room north. or, move the connection in spli
Meina    (Jul 13 2019) [ 3002] Reconfigure secret tunnel from Smugglers to Helena's to better rep the world distance: starting at Tunnel off Hidden Cavern, make first bend in tunnel 4n, one room w, 4n, and about 16 rooms west. Or add bends anywhere, but basically 8n and 17w from s
Meina    (Jul 13 2019) [ 3002] from previous idea: from smugs.
Meina    (Jul 15 2019) [ 1666] It is probably a bit evil for a low level zone, but the pit vipers seem like they should poison.
Meina    (Jul 17 2019) [ 3043] Quest turn in to combine extra drakling scales into something interesting. Not necessarily armor, maybe a purely decorational badge or something that can be deposited in bank for safe keeping - or storage in a trophy room!
Gennaire (Jul 17 2019) [ 3044] Incorporate turning in the T1 armor as part of the T2 armor quests - so that the final step to get the new piece is to turn in the old piece. Or make it optional for additional xp or something.
Meina    (Aug 14 2019) [ 2019] Include weight total of inventory items when checking inventory.
Gennaire (Aug 15 2019) [ 3054] facepalm social, for those moments when headdesk is too much but you just gotta express yourself.
Utaboshi (Aug 26 2019) [ 3001] Add a zone flag to display!
Utaboshi (Aug 29 2019) [ 3009] Add a page size toggle (or a infinite) so we don't get the "return to continue..." nonsense :)
Mejna    (Aug 29 2019) [20329] Similar to the logging camp, the small stream in Gothra Plains could be made into a drinkable thing. It really adds to the immersive feel.
Mejna    (Sep 01 2019) [20324] Should be drinkable water here at the water hole :)
Meina    (Sep 03 2019) [16371] The Fiery Red drakling scale should have a wee bit o color in the name!
Gennaire (Sep 04 2019) [20308] Rogue skill: hamstring. Has a chance to prevent mobs from being able to flee.
Mejna    (Sep 04 2019) [ 2002] Ability to tame a wild dog - would be nice to have a canine pet :D
Mejna    (Sep 07 2019) [ 2542] 11 rooms of road in South Caelia, and no smallish mobs around - perhaps a few additions similar to Black Rock Trail, Old Merchant Trail, Great Road, Great Northern Road and Niko Trail would make it more lively and interesting.
Gennaire (Sep 07 2019) [ 4000] The entrance to black ice desert and layveran lab are same point of black rock trail. Make those first few rooms show as black ice instead of lab, to build more mystery for the true entrance to the dangerous part of lab.
Meina    (Sep 08 2019) [ 3054] in Nymrill where you have the choice to go left or right, and both currently take you to Mielikki's altar, mix it up and have the left option take you to Ogakh. Worst case, the ported person has to buy a green to get to mainland, but it seems fitting
Gizelle  (Sep 10 2019) [ 8405] Include damage type in identify information for weapons to indicate what skill is required.
Mejna    (Sep 21 2019) [49215] swoon social.
Meina    (Sep 23 2019) [49521] Have gray scrolls for sale in Nymrill.
Meina    (Sep 23 2019) [49521] Expand the Misty Caverns Lava Tunnels north of the bubble to have a few more mob types (for trophy purposes), and a few more rooms - maybe some hidden stuff, so that it is similar size to the south of the lava bubble section.
Dakhod   (Sep 24 2019) [ 3054] fart should not be a social but should be something that happens involuntarily at random times
Dakhod   (Sep 24 2019) [ 3054] new wear position....worn on crotch....magic g strings?
Dakhod   (Sep 24 2019) [ 3054] well maybe that would be worn on groin
Dakhod   (Sep 24 2019) [ 3054] rebrand fiery as a cybersex platform where all the mobs just talk dirty to you. kind of like one of those 900 numbers. of course someone would need to man the phones....chinok
Gennaire (Sep 25 2019) [ 2475] Add a description when people look writing here.
Mejna    (Sep 25 2019) [ 2356] Add a description when you look at runes in this room.
Ija      (Sep 25 2019) [47812] fix layhands so it works with vamptouch again 
Ija      (Sep 25 2019) [47812] or make vamptouch a passave effect that works with weapons
Mejna    (Sep 25 2019) [ 2677] Split South Caelia Forests and Mountains into multiple zones - this place is just too massive!
Nawk     (Sep 25 2019) [48820] theif should get shadow
Gennaire (Sep 26 2019) [32462] South Caelia Highlands should drop T2 armor parts instead of T1.
Gizelle  (Sep 26 2019) [32447] The fancy description of the bronze dagger doesn't match it's stats.
Gizelle  (Sep 26 2019) [32447] to clarify I mean the one off desperate bandit in South Caelia Highlands
Gennaire (Sep 26 2019) [ 2601] Lake Fedis needs more to it - actual water lake rooms.
Mejna    (Sep 26 2019) [ 2751] There should be something hidden in this room, like behind a web or something.
Offa     (Oct 03 2019) [ 3054] a lesser res no exp recoverd just delete the corpse and move all eq to charactor pal and clerics
Mejna    (Oct 03 2019) [ 1800] The stream referenced in Forest of Shadows could feed into the Black Lake (Nikozian Trail, Kaaz Plains section), and utilize the canoe that drops nearby.
Gizelle  (Oct 03 2019) [58619] violet-colored linen robes i Beachhead are a bit low for the level of the zone and mob difficulty. More AC in the body slot would beef them up, and raising level to 20 instead of 15.
Gizelle  (Oct 03 2019) [58619] spyglass in Beachhead is rated level 10, should probably be level 20.
Meina    (Oct 03 2019) [58709] The level of difficulty of the mobs in this zone seems more suited for a party of 30 somethings than 20 somethings, but the xp given seems more suited for 20s than 30s.  I suggest either upping the xp or lowering the mob difficulty just a bit.
Meina    (Oct 04 2019) [58709] Add two east-west rooms to Red Rock Path and Rocky Path, plus 5 north-south or up/down Soft Path rooms to line up Foot of Mt Gladstone in Iron Hills and Canyon
Mejna    (Oct 04 2019) [58670] Similar to skill mastery, add some kind of visual 'mastered' in the zone list for players who have visited all rooms, killed all mobs, and completed all quests in a given zone.
Meina    (Oct 07 2019) [ 3054] Add more marshland and bayou rooms in The Bayou, with a few more animal mob-types. Can probably do 15-20 rooms surrounding the existing soggy marsh and bayou rooms, move Greengreen Sea a bit northeast of current location, add a few water rooms to Bay
Meina    (Oct 07 2019) [ 3054] (continued) add a few water rooms to Bayou and connect to Greengreen Sea.
Meina    (Oct 07 2019) [ 3054] lo
Meina    (Oct 07 2019) [ 3054] Sorry for that typo.
Gennaire (Oct 07 2019) [30066] Tinilas, the half-elven rogue in Ogakh, is a great candidate for a quest (in addition to or instead of the current tier1 armor quests).
Davar    (Oct 08 2019) [ 3054] a skill that throws a cleric over a mortally wounded group memeber and protects them from the final blow
Davar    (Oct 08 2019) [ 3054] think fatal rescue
Meina    (Oct 09 2019) [59046] The golden robe is worn 'about body' instead of 'on body', but the description indicates this is less of an outerwear garment and more an inner wear.
Gizelle  (Oct 09 2019) [59054] The -1 dex on the adornment of light doesn't quite make sense. Maybe instead is should make it impossible to hide while wearing it?
Mejna    (Oct 09 2019) [59060] the Guard of the Brotherhood should probably assist the headguard.
Mejna    (Oct 09 2019) [59086] It doesn't seem helpful to have hidden group members not appear in group.
Meina    (Oct 10 2019) [ 5594] Status for the black legion/3rd eldorian guard should also let you know which turn-ins you have done, similar to armor quests.
Meina    (Oct 12 2019) [ 3054] When you free Kwan in Odz, it would be cool if it made the sea serpent aggro, similar to killing LARGE seether frees the draklings.
Utaboshi (Oct 14 2019) [ 5566] Add Zone name to prompt
Gizelle  (Oct 16 2019) [55923] The dwarf who is sharpening his axe should have a chance at carrying a sharpening stone (similar or same as the one off zombie pirates).
Meina    (Oct 16 2019) [13342] The bugs and whatnot in the Limestone Shaft section of the Miner's Cavern need to be tougher and more in line with the targeted level range. Possibly drop T2 armor gems.
Meina    (Oct 16 2019) [13342] the Badger in the Heart of the Mine in Miner's Cavern needs to be much tougher, and aggro.
Gizelle  (Oct 16 2019) [13358] Starlight in Miner's Cavern should be much tougher - closer to level 35 or 40.
Gizelle  (Oct 16 2019) [13358] white flame has -1 str, +2 hitroll. It should be flagged magic, and the -str seems an unnecessary negative.
Meina    (Oct 29 2019) [58358] Syric needs at least one aggro mob, similar to other trails. Possibly a wolf or bear.
Meina    (Oct 29 2019) [58334] Syric Mtn should drop T2 gems, not T1.
Gizelle  (Oct 29 2019) [ 3071] add command float to enable transitions from resting to standing to floating when you have an effect like levitate active
Mejna    (Nov 01 2019) [ 3009] Ruby Wristlet should have 'Ruby' in red.
Harnv    (Nov 09 2019) [ 8562] can we get an area alignment added to the "help areas" text :)
Kilop    (Nov 17 2019) [37017] make "search" function not detect players or at least grouped members!
Mejna    (Nov 29 2019) [58688] Add lastsay, similar to lasttel and lastgos
Mejna    (Dec 09 2019) [ 1270] Quests for rentable keys that open god rooms :D
Mejna    (Dec 18 2019) [ 3009] swoon social. swoons at your feet.
Mejna    (Jan 06 2020) [ 3009] add help file for encumbrance so players can see the basic scale/which description is more encumbered than another
Mejna    (Jan 09 2020) [ 2475] Sphere of the west in the monolith/druid quest in South Caelia is too easy compared to sphere of the north.
Mejna    (Jan 09 2020) [ 2359] Let rangers do the druid-only quest from the high druid in South Caelia, cuz we love nature too!
Meina    (Jan 09 2020) [ 2363] Add lower level group heals like group cure light, group cure serious, group cure crit to round out healing capabilities.
Mejna    (Jan 10 2020) [ 5115] failed rescue should attack monster, similar to the way failed backstab attempts to hit the mob.
Gizelle  (Jan 14 2020) [ 3052] Identify spell should include max number of pages of spellbook.
Mejna    (Feb 03 2020) [58195] There should be peanut butter somewhere.
Gennaire (Feb 03 2020) [58195] when unlocking something, the item used to unlock should be reflected in the message, lke 'you unlock the door with a bronze key'.
Mejna    (Feb 04 2020) [ 3002] Expose message board to the forum and vice versa, so that posts to the in-game board post on the forum, and potentially give folks a way to post from the forum to the in-game board.
Meina    (Feb 04 2020) [ 5213] Ability to 'leech' a buff: The caster casts the buffing spell, and has the option to leave it 'leeched', meaning that spell slot is still in use/can't be cast again from that slot until the caster 'cuts' the leech, the target logs out or dies.  This 
Meina    (Feb 04 2020) [ 5213] (continued from previous) this would help reduce the more boring and repetitive recast of buffs.
Mejna    (Feb 17 2020) [ 5210] newbie channel: similar to gossip, but with its own toggles, where newbies can ask for help and get answers, no rp expected.
Chinok   (Feb 24 2020) [ 1270] testing 123 123 idea

Mejna    (Mar 31 2020) [ 3009] Blue-Fog Trail is not really ok for level 35, even grouped.  Suggest moving level range to 45-55.
Mejna    (Mar 31 2020) [ 1683] Add petition channel to the chat pane in mudlet plugin.
Gizelle  (May 01 2020) [ 2333] Sell scrolls of fly at borderhold to make adventuring in Dargentan's Lair more feasible.
Davar    (May 24 2020) [53507] change ice and fire armor to be % of max hp return damage keep the damage the same for player vs ice/fire but increase it for mob vs playye ice/fire would be a nice buff for mages
Gilgal   (May 24 2020) [53516] or have cold/fire shield calulate as though the damage wasn't negated by stoneskin
Kuvira   (May 25 2020) [ 3054] nibble is an interesting social, but it is normal to nibble FOOD. This command should work similar to taste when the target is food.
Mejna    (May 26 2020) [10200] Add Mount Frostbite to the zones list
Mejna    (May 27 2020) [55012] Traveling merchants might have goods for sale - have list command work when near a traveling merch.
Mejna    (May 28 2020) [55020] traveling merchant in tech description about conning people doesn't seem consistent with his good align.
Meina    (Jun 04 2020) [55112] when you enter pool here, you get the message 'you feel your energy being drained' and i wonder if this used to zap mana, and if there is something it should do now.
Mejna    (Jun 05 2020) [ 8601] Include number of deaths in your stats/character attributes, along with playtime.
Mejna    (Jun 06 2020) [ 7417] mudlet map - unexplored exits and exits to other zones currently look the same, which is pretty confusing. Maybe have known exits/explored exits to other zones be a different color.
Mejna    (Jun 06 2020) [ 3550] Rangers only get 1 circle 7 spell, and it is a self-only spell. Instead of getting additional circle 7 slots, it would be more useful to get more circle 6.
Mejna    (Jun 08 2020) [ 5207] More interactive problem solving quests like the one in Enchanted Hollow, and less reliance on guess the keyword quests. (Make this my problem someday)
Mejna    (Jun 08 2020) [ 3550] Allow casters to mem lower level spells in higher circles - ie, i have 3 circle 7 slots, but only 1 circle 7 spell i want, i could use the other 2 slots for circle 6 or lower spells.
Yuhen    (Jun 10 2020) [ 1270] allow "inventory" and "skill" should be targetible for players on their pets/zombies
Trinigwarn (Jun 10 2020) [ 3054] social distance emote
Kuvira   (Jun 10 2020) [10035] Mara should sell yummy packets of food.
Kuvira   (Jun 11 2020) [36400] Add Sirestis' Folly to zone list, similar to Mt. Frostbite
Kuvira   (Jun 11 2020) [58802] include rarity information in identify stats, ie. if it is a reset item or not. This will help folks be more efficient hoarders especially newer folks who don't already know taht info.
Kuvira   (Jun 12 2020) [10039] swoon as a social.
Meina    (Jun 14 2020) [55136] tie in between demon plane inside tech and black ice desert
Yuhen    (Jun 17 2020) [ 8122] zombies and pets should not take a share of experience
Mejna    (Jun 18 2020) [53364] include petition in the comms window for mudlet.
Meina    (Jun 19 2020) [ 6209] Flamestrike and fireball should have a chance to melt a coldshield.
Meina    (Jun 19 2020) [ 6209] or, if they manage to light the target on fire it should also speed the decay of the coldshield.
Fayris   (Jun 22 2020) [43010] zombies should be automatically in the group of the necro, and take no share of the exp
Mejna    (Jun 25 2020) [ 5277] Rangers should be able to quest for the guard skill, to prove they are truly protectors.
Mimbelag (Jul 06 2020) [36001] Add more hooks and hints in Temple of Kaaz for the drakling quest, perhaps having the priests, mages, or seethers upstairs mutter about it, or some extra descriptions in the rooms that include images of the draklings. Also have the LARGE seether say 
Mimbelag (Jul 06 2020) [ 8025] continued: say somethign menacing on entrance.
Griffette (Jul 08 2020) [ 8828] There should be something in the brown package at Dairy Farm.
Griffette (Jul 09 2020) [17200] Allow bodyslam in combat. Not entirely sure why it isn't allowed now.
Griffette (Jul 09 2020) [ 3020] Weapons seem to take a significantly longer amount of time to improve than skills, despite being used more often. Some type of rp reason for this would be good to provide so folks don't think their weapons are broken.

Meina    (Jan 10 2022) [ 3054] Let clerics get more lower circle spells if they don't want to mem higher level spells. I.e. I don't use greater vitality at all (too risky), but i'd love to get a few more group heals or full heals.
