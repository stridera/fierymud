Korak    (Oct  5) [17200] is there any way that experience could be listed after it is gained.  This way players know which monsters they are making progress on.  For instance, I don't have too many different mobs to fight, at lv 13, and am not sure whether a mob I'm fighting
Korak    (Oct  5) [17200] sorry truncated .... (was saying) is giving my significant xp.  An idea, thanks.
Korak    (Oct  5) [17200] another idea .... could there be an Armor Class stat so players know exactly what their armor is?  I have no way of knowing if one type of armor is better than another ... (cont.)
Korak    (Oct  5) [17200] (AC cont.)  It would be a lot more fun if I knew what armor was effective etc.  For instance, I feel like I cannot fight more difficult mobs because my ac is 
Korak    (Oct  5) [17200] (ac cont.) too weak yet armor in town costs like 30 platinum which is (correct me if wrong) like 3000 silver.  I want to buy better armor but with 1 silver per monster It's difficult.  How am I to know how effective this armor is?

Korak    (Oct  5) [17200] (cont. Sorry!) ... improvement curve on Fiery.  
Korak    (Oct  5) [17200] (cont cont cont) I think things like listed ac, exp, and thaco would gratify the players in their endless quest for improvement.  I don't want to sound like a whiner, wanting a million level ups in 10 minutes
Korak    (Oct  5) [17200] i guess with the ac and thaco suggestion would be actual stat numbers too .... so we could know what gives bonuses.  thanks, Korak

Nardok   (Oct  6) [ 3002] how about a marker for the last note you read on a particular board?

Puzo     (Oct  7) [53076] Make it so you cannot have your pets gossip
Tanle    (Oct 13) [ 1222] how about a nifty command that says what classes can go with what races ??
Tanle    (Oct 13) [ 1222] see previous submission:  or perhaps the 'subclass' command could be interpreted to allow gods (or everyone *shrug*) to type subclass followed by a race letter/name
Zagur    (Oct 14) [ 8020] can we give warriors triple attack
Tanle    (Oct 15) [ 1222] let's get mages the ability to get a familiar.. something like i have envisioned which is better personally described than 'idea'ed'

Korak    (Oct 25) [ 3084] I think that ... and this may already be occuring, money should play a larger role in the world of Fiery.  It seems like what the stores have to offer is both minimal and expensive (IE 28 platinum for a steel breastplate)
Korak    (Oct 25) [ 3084] if the items were made cheaper or maybe more valuable (they are the best and can only be obtained via the stores) then money take on more importance.  Korak :)
