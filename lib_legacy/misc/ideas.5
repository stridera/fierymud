Frumly   (Mar 24 2009) [ 3054] the 10 hidenness from an eldorian shiv should help the results of an attempt to hide.

Mosiah   (Apr 29 2009) [ 1402] i think cleric's spells should have less alignment restritions, flamestrike bless

Gidion   (May 12 2009) [43159] i think the pay out for the chests in demise keep should be better then 30 gold for instence items that are middle level eq
Venath   (May 12 2009) [ 1208] Can we make the bug/typo/idea submission either have a higher buffer, or make it similar to the board/mail posting system. So that we don't have any orphaned issues on mantis.
Fayris   (May 14 2009) [43004] the dying knight may be dying but he should still have some skills. not sure if he even has a class
Foosha   (May 15 2009) [ 8050] to make firewall usefull, maybe it could have a chance to stop, but a second or 3rd try would let a wanderer thru. each attempt would deal damage reguardless
Flike    (May 16 2009) [17274] the gargoyles in citadel of testing respawn too fast
Xoxx     (May 16 2009) [ 5512] we can team

Sork     (May 20 2009) [53217] you know what would be neat, a skill that could be used to knock someone into the next room, could be similar to bash, in that they couldn't be bigger than you, and similar to doorbash....

Fayris   (May 24 2009) [ 3054] those with doorbash should be able to doorbash thru wall of ice. you might give it a chance to fail based on the skill of the caster, and the size of the basher
Foosha   (May 24 2009) [12599] fireball for sorcs should be moved to cirlce 7 with bigby's, tho a weaker spell, it would be an alternative composition choise. no sorc uses it because they have to sacrifice fly or stone or haste
Fahl     (May 24 2009) [11719] mist form and other forms might not me out of the question if forms other than flesh and bone were exempt from stoneskin. also more form spells should be implemented, to keep options open for casters

Laoris   (Jun 02 2009) [ 1275] if no god is on, petitions should be logged and shown when one shows up; actually, all petitions should be logged; actually almost all communication should be logged :>
Gilgal   (Jun 02 2009) [18500] think with me if you throat just got cut you would think that there would be a 1/4 chance that you wound be able to cast a spell with a hole in it
Flike    (Jun 03 2009) [17809] detonation does the same or less damage as/than burning hands. maybe burning hands needs to do less? not sure
Vitkus   (Jun 03 2009) [ 3054] to balance out the overpowered dr, some weapons should be 1 handed, but !double attack, like the javalins. then one has to decide between many hits vs hard hits
Fayris   (Jun 04 2009) [52093] bone composition should apply to necros with bone armor
Fernius  (Jun 04 2009) [20338] some low level guys, like the elephants in the plains, want to assist, and should. the lowby assist blocker should be set individualy for mobs that have assist

Duron    (Jun 05 2009) [51068] in medit, there should be a gender option for "either"; then when the mob is actually loaded, it randomly chooses male or female
Flike    (Jun 05 2009) [ 5515] seems like all 3 of my circles of pyro spells do the same damage

Faegern  (Jun 07 2009) [ 3070] the cool down on retreat is longer than flee, kinda lame.. makes it better to flee into agro rooms
Flike    (Jun 12 2009) [ 5450] the cooldowns for skills suck as lay hands and chant should be on the score prompt, or some less invasive way of seeing them than having it on the prompt
Flike    (Jun 13 2009) [ 5205] the waves of phoshporic embers should be a random number
Laoris   (Jun 13 2009) [ 1275] make waterwalk last a really long time
Meina    (Jun 14 2009) [ 5479] flimsy leather leggings are magic but dont actually do anything.  Weird.
Laoris   (Jun 15 2009) [ 3054] make players regen at a gradual rate while logged off, instead of "if you've been offline for an hour, you get all your hp back"; also maybe make necros slowly lose built up drained hp whiel logged off
Fernius  (Jun 15 2009) [ 5529] %dX in the prompt commands doesnt allow any changes to be made to its color. i'd like to be able to apply a color to it but it seems to have a build in &0
Fernius  (Jun 15 2009) [ 5515] some classes, particularly necro should be able to see life source as easily as composition
Flike    (Jun 15 2009) [ 5557] standard rogue ai at pretty much any level should be to backstab when not tanking
Rubra    (Jun 15 2009) [36001] let druids cast while shapechanged
Flike    (Jun 16 2009) [ 5554] locate object should still work while blind, i think. you see it in your mind, eyes arent needed
Flike    (Jun 16 2009) [18551] the wyvern in highlands needs some serious nerfing
Fernius  (Jun 16 2009) [12581] to keep the exp resonable for the quests at combat in eldaria, they should have a one item per day limit. then the quests ae still a grat reward, but not a plvler
Fasq     (Jun 16 2009) [17248] a wizards familiar in the citadel of testing doesnt have a life force of magic? what does?
Fernius  (Jun 17 2009) [58056] check the frequencies on colorspray, the negative buffs dont seem to land very often
Fahl     (Jun 17 2009) [12534] the blue dragons key has troubles respawning in tower of the waste
Flike    (Jun 17 2009) [ 5166] dispel magic delt 46 damage from a lvl 27. is it ever going to deal enough damage to be worth using? or is it just ment to be as a nice perk if i want to dispel anyways?
Mosiah   (Jun 17 2009) [ 1401] would some one please work on the fiery inland quest it is so twitchy i failed it becouse i killed the ash lord with full harm instead of mela damage
Fernius  (Jun 18 2009) [50238] the stats for the ghost pirates sabre should be swapped with the bandit cheiftains scimitar
Foosha   (Jun 18 2009) [16014] detectmagic should make the life force or magic apparent like detect alingment would for alignment
Fahl     (Jun 18 2009) [16071] battle hymn should allow a monk to hit insubstantials, and have a much lower boost of hr and dr, like maybe 3hr 2dr at mastered
Fernius  (Jun 28 2009) [41145] The Burnt Togair in seawitch should probably be made of plant material
Bomnor   (Jul 02 2009) [10053] please please please add chants to the 'cooldown' on the prompts.
Flike    (Jul 05 2009) [50208] phosphoric embers and immolate should both give a message when the waves of damage are over
Flike    (Jul 05 2009) [50208] spell concept: while embers or immolate are still active any fire damage from other spells adds a wave (or a %chance to lengthen). each spell would only count for one instance, not several for firedarts or waves
Flike    (Jul 05 2009) [50209] possibly limmit the wave adding to only fire spells from the caster of the wave spell.. so it wont become 2 pyros doing exponential damage per second
Flike    (Jul 05 2009) [50211] cryo freezing effect should only have a %chance to break from that same cryo's cold damage, the opposite effect being lengthened freeze. would make room cold damage more useful. i find it hazardous as is
Flike    (Jul 05 2009) [50244] better idea: scrap the compounding length on wave damage, and have all firedamage have a chance to coumpound the burning status (have a tally of how intence the flames are instead of a yes or no to burning)
Flike    (Jul 05 2009) [50244] that last one probably has more potential to get out of hand than the orriginal idea :P
Zzig     (Jul 14 2009) [ 3054] on the pray/mem command.  the spells you are currently memming needs to go at the bottom of the display, not the top. :)
Gluke    (Jul 14 2009) [ 5478] make dark red vambraces lower level; i can kill the evli mist priest but can't wear the eq

Laoris   (Jul 15 2009) [10307] allow use of vnums with where command (or as keywords in general?)

Laoris   (Jul 15 2009) [ 3002] add privilege flag to allow turning off level gain for specific characters
Laoris   (Jul 15 2009) [ 3002] write a help file about hp regen
Laoris   (Jul 15 2009) [ 3002] show hp regen stat somewhere like on score
Fernius  (Jul 16 2009) [ 3009] the mount skill needs to skill up faster.. now that mounting isnt all too hard with the right horses. no need to practice for an hour in the fields
Flike    (Jul 16 2009) [ 3094] somewhere, either in memorise or spell lists, it should say how many total spells you can mem in each circle. for instance "circle 1 (7) 4 - minor creation"
Flike    (Jul 16 2009) [ 3094] there should be something between farsee and wizards eye. maybe seeing through closed doors and in portals and wells
Fayris   (Jul 16 2009) [ 3054] replace burning hands for necros with a low level leachlife. maybe a self target vamp touch spell, same as antis, but a spell that must be cast.
Faegern  (Jul 16 2009) [48801] retreat needs to go whether fighting or not
Kreedra  (Jul 17 2009) [48901] don't autosplit when getting from your own corpse
Laoris   (Jul 17 2009) [ 1275] make npcs 'afraid' of player corpses
Faus     (Jul 17 2009) [47013] the dark things in the graveyard should be evil.  atleast, it seems like they should be
Flike    (Jul 18 2009) [ 3054] thieves should gain an escape ability. something comperable to retreat. something beyond a paniced flee. and it should automaticaly hide the player
Prin     (Jul 19 2009) [ 8220] don't make people full when they die
Fernley  (Jul 19 2009) [36123] vamp touch needs to leach from layhands again
Laoris   (Jul 19 2009) [ 1275] instead of different skills/attacks having to manually figure out whether they hit or not, have some sort of hidden "missability" rating that takes everything into account
Dezin    (Jul 19 2009) [ 5113] autoassist, that is all
Dezin    (Jul 19 2009) [ 8025] make paladin lay hands do nothing if target is good and at full hp
Ofa      (Jul 20 2009) [18538] if a theif is smart enough to find a sleeping mob they should still improve there skill from stealing from them :)
Laoris   (Jul 20 2009) [ 1275] make dark presence give dr at lower skill levels too, like from 1 to 3
Fernley  (Jul 20 2009) [ 3025] put bag of flour at the bottom of aarons list, so 'buy bag' buys the bag, not the flour
Dezin    (Jul 21 2009) [ 5539] show skill # in command
Dezin    (Jul 21 2009) [ 5553] eye gouge lasts too long
Fernley  (Jul 21 2009) [ 5521] kick should add an effect for 1-3 rounds lowering hr and ac
Ofa      (Jul 21 2009) [ 8301] i think that antis sould get a bonice vamp off from there lay hands or at least what they normaly would get :) there laying hands and it is vamptouch you know :)
Fernley  (Jul 22 2009) [ 5556] the rogues and mercenaries in the eldorian foces should be nuetral
Ijja     (Jul 22 2009) [ 5566] the quartermaster sould keep beter track of what we have givne him
Felk     (Jul 25 2009) [58031] dark pres should actualy lower alignment for the durration
Fasq     (Jul 26 2009) [23889] insanity should increase stregnth
Ijja     (Jul 27 2009) [ 3054] i like the change with the Paladin 3rd class quest leader
Meina    (Jul 28 2009) [ 3054] pinch social!
Flike    (Jul 30 2009) [51102] any skill cooldown that says you have to rest first like chant, layhands and TC should actualy recharge faster when you are resting or sleeping
Fernius  (Jul 31 2009) [32570] poison should hurt movement points too
Laoris   (Aug 02 2009) [ 1275] add damage flags to mark damage as internal or external (external damage gets reduced by stoneskin, etc, internal damage does not)
Fernius  (Aug 06 2009) [ 5203] make a quest spell for cry/pyr/nec called 'harness cold/fire/death' respectivly. sorcs should get its free still and fits all spell. the other only thier sphere
Kiram    (Aug 06 2009) [11753] im not sure this is a bug or idea, but chain lightning seems to always do much less damage then stanard lightning bolt.  that doesnt make much sense to me
Faus     (Aug 06 2009) [11755] the mist 'demon' should be evil, IMO.  demons are generally evil.  much more evil then mist beasts i would imagine
Faus     (Aug 07 2009) [49046] ya'll need to get rid of laryngitis.  sometimes you need to spam to get word to your peeps in the beat of the spam of battle.  i mean, really, your going to ruin it for players because of the .05% who spam shit on a mud?  seriously.  knock it off.
Fernius  (Aug 10 2009) [23712] list regen on the score board stats. including natural regen (based on constitution, right?
Flike    (Aug 17 2009) [39135] chill and freeze effects should last twice as long on water
Flike    (Aug 17 2009) [39135] cryos need a spell or 2 to be castable only on water, or more potent on water. maybe an upwelling which would knock a target over into another room
Flike    (Aug 17 2009) [ 3009] dragons health should be a mix of greater vitality and regen. much more usefull than just mass hp to have the regen to make it usefull
Oody     (Aug 23 2009) [10306] make a group stone spell for mage types  make it circle 13 
Faus     (Oct 20 2009) [23733] gr should be short for group not groan.  i dunno if you can change something like that but it'd be swell.
Hanzar   (Oct 30 2009) [ 2007] north
Kria     (Dec 08 2009) [ 5190] when trying to first aid yourself, if you have already used it in the past 24 hours, it should tell you how much longer you have, similar to chant
Kria     (Jan 03 2010) [55094] you hsould be able to start combat with corner... if you fail while fighting and the mob flees, you dont get another chance because you cant use corner when not fighting
Kria     (Jan 08 2010) [55111] it doesnt make sense that monks can springleap mobs, but they cant knock them down from a standing positio...i know bash doesnt make sense for monks, but maybe a tackle or soemthing? just a thought
Venath   (Jan 12 2010) [ 3054] Automate all imm quest spells...yeah...what a big freakin' project that's gonna be...ugh...
Venath   (Jan 12 2010) [ 3054] add an emote for FTW "for the win" or you can make it "fuck the what?"

Venath   (Feb 03 2010) [ 1275] make blind remove aware flag if it doesn't already
Sata     (Feb 04 2010) [48046] put a death counter that a player can see in their score
Venath   (Feb 05 2010) [ 1208] instead of permanent race alignment...just start the races off with good or negative alignment...or neutral. Then allow them to choose their paths.
Venath   (Feb 05 2010) [ 1208] I have a brilliant idea...let's get player accounts going already eh? PLEASE! FOR THE LOVE OF GODS!
Vyx      (Feb 13 2010) [59057] in sacred haven, belward has a neutral alignment, but if hes the paladin 3rd tier armor questmater you'd think hed be good
Venath   (Feb 16 2010) [ 1208] druids should get a thief class shapechange...like a monkey or something...not good steal mind you, but yeah...
Venath   (Feb 17 2010) [ 1208] laryngitis should not affect people using tell...at least on tell you can ignore people...any channel that can be observed by multiple people though should be affected by laryngitis
Venath   (Feb 17 2010) [ 1208] addendum: any private communication channel should be laryngitis free
Venath   (Feb 17 2010) [ 1208] can we please have an updated editor? Where we can do lots of cool things easily like adjust mob hit/dam dice. Where we can add customized damage messages...etc...
Pyxen    (Feb 17 2010) [55087] you would think casting a powerful enough fire spell on a mob that has coldshiel would melt the ice shards around their body
Venath   (Mar 03 2010) [ 2217] haste should give up to 2 extra hits. Blur should give up to 4 extra hits and override haste completely.
Venath   (Mar 03 2010) [ 2217] two-handed weapons should get 1 extra hit with haste and 2 extra hits with blur. 
Pyxen    (Mar 19 2010) [55047] trackers sould be able to specify to track the last opponent they faced, incase th mob flees. they should be able to follow their blood flow or something.
Hortur   (Mar 20 2010) [49065] energy drain for anti-paladins?
Vera     (Apr 03 2010) [48000] anti-paladins should have access to the black-ice flail
Hortur   (Apr 05 2010) [ 8536] man seriously, frozen mobs should not be able to dodge your throatcut or backstab or anythign else for that matter!
Nerl     (Apr 08 2010) [ 5555] those that have bodyslam shoud innately bodyslam when they rescue or guard some one irl most bodyguards dont have time to draw a weapon to protect some one  the just bodyslam them
Figh     (Apr 09 2010) [ 3054] make a higher level druid spell much like moon beam, but can be cast indoors. doesnt matter really if its room or target

Syra     (Apr 24 2010) [ 8069] Every time you level, trophy list can be cleared.
Hortur   (Apr 24 2010) [48901] it should say which key you use to unlock a door instead of just click
Flike    (Apr 30 2010) [47026] bone composition should be reassigned to 'reanimated' which would include zxombies
Fahl     (Apr 30 2010) [53333] your light should light up adjecent rooms too, so farsee is worth having
Moltac   (May 02 2010) [37021] Shouldn't Pyro and cryo get harness also?
Teomner  (May 04 2010) [ 3071] acid attacks need to should get *** on all things that the hit becouse of howmany they dont hit at all
Mosiah   (May 06 2010) [ 8141] being able to check which quests one has done with out the aid of a imm would be most help full as well as aloing people to search out wuests that they have not done
Tium     (May 06 2010) [ 3054] Assassins have abduct ability. Target a victim to drag out of the room, victim will engage after abduction, if failed victim simply engages on the spot.
Flike    (May 07 2010) [23723] acid atacks should drop ac.. some of them
Flike    (May 07 2010) [23725] firestorm has a painful cast time
Offa     (May 08 2010) [ 3040] rangers should get heal in circle 10 or mabie a heal that comes in waves 3 heals of 100-200
Flike    (May 09 2010) [16020] the base damage of fireshield should be higher, sinse a mage usually uses it at the same time as stoneskin
Bjorn    (May 09 2010) [16375] make the jewel of the heart not a treasure item.  Lots of accidental screw ups for the druid quest
Flike    (May 10 2010) [ 5200] please make firestorm more useful.. shoirter cast time, maybe?
Faegern  (May 10 2010) [43024] the sentries in demise need to be toned down a bit. havent been rescaled sinse they were turned to metal. maybe just thin them out a bit. 10 in a room is nearly unkillable
Faegern  (May 10 2010) [43024] riposte switching targets is a huge anoyance. can it not do that any more? i'd almost want to toggle the skill off
Flike    (May 14 2010) [ 1402] retreat should work for portals and wells as a target dirrection
Flike    (May 17 2010) [51055] make a high level dispell magic based spell that deals damage and dispels and does extra damage for each buff removed. possibly sorc only quest spell?
Flike    (May 18 2010) [ 3054] the progretion of pyro spells is kinda awkward. 3 circles with no fire, 3 circles of bighitter single target, 3 circles room nuke. put cremate a circle or 2 earlier
Offa     (May 21 2010) [37021] i dont like the "other types" of dammage ie the broad bladed javelins do stabing? and the maddend taeree limb bites? they seem to have no bonices and all negitivs though they seem to be a tipe of weapon just not the normal damage  i think we sould ch
Fayris   (May 21 2010) [ 3064] why cant i put an npc to sleep and drag them around? thats how the animal control does it irl!
Flike    (May 21 2010) [51006] replace the *'s on the composition help file with the actualy number adjustments, 100 being no change. it's misleading to see ** for crushvmetal or * for firevwater
Fayris   (May 26 2010) [ 5303] a preliminary spell to life tap and enerygy drain could be waves of health taken from undead, that wouldnt make petzombies go agro. good for killing zombies,, or for healing yourself. either cap at 100% or give smaller returns past full hp
Fayris   (May 26 2010) [ 5303] the spell stregnths based on circles needs fixing. sorcs cast the best fireball, rangers cast the  best lightning bolt, and necros cast the best stone. it was better off before. the earlier learned, the better it becomes
Flike    (May 26 2010) [16068] pile of coins in mystwatches strongbox is pretty weak. any mob has more than that on them
Fayris   (May 26 2010) [ 8025] pyre should put fireshield on the person it's burning. a funny way to make zombies more effective at the cost of their health
Felk     (May 26 2010) [ 8099] track at aweful is nearly impossible to skill. maybe it should always start at bad
Kiram    (May 27 2010) [ 2021] the star shaped piece of metaldoesnt actuially have the keyword 'metal'
Figh     (May 28 2010) [ 5303] natures embrace should be castable sitting, so the druid can pray hidden
Figh     (May 28 2010) [ 5303] make a water spray spell. low level water damage for cryon, mid for druid. single target preferably
Figh     (May 28 2010) [ 5303] all plant based spells for the druid should be sphere of earth. lame that a druid only has 2 earth spells
Figh     (May 28 2010) [ 5303] cloak of gaia should be castable on anyone, but still leaves when the character leaves nature. no reason druids cant armor someone else. make then useful clerics in their zone
Foosha   (May 28 2010) [ 8025] harness needs to effect dispel magic too
Flike    (May 30 2010) [48221] a priest quest spell to heal and harm the room, friend and foe respectively
