Dril     (Aug 11 2022) [ 3009] This may be a type or a bug but I am able to chant spirit of the bear before level 60 so either the help has a type or its a bug? 
Dril     (Aug 11 2022) [ 3009] this may not be a bug but the intention but it feel like a bug. If I berserk while meditating I am in a standing relaxed state and can't move or attack without 'alert' first. If this is the intention it might be good to have it in the help somehow. I was stuck for a few minutes before Daedela helped me.
Dril     (Aug 11 2022) [18552] it looks like the text for `help prompt` is using the formatting code that it should be displaying. I am seeing the formatting applied to the text and not the formatting that I could be using.
Dril     (Aug 12 2022) [53329] battle howl's usage is howl but howl is already an emote so I just emote instead of using the skill.

Meeka    (Aug 22 2022) [51907] during training for a rogue (maybe others I didn't test) the Measter of the Revel gives 2 gold coins but in the score there are not any gold coins so when you are asked to deposit 1 gold 1 silver 1 copperyou don't have enough gold the rest of the triggers carry you forward but it is strange to see you don't have enough gold even though you should have just received enough.

Fril     (Aug 26 2022) [56406] I think something is wrong with the restting of zones. It has happened several times in several zones today and yesterday where the zone will reset while I am fighitng someone and then now I am fighing two diabolists of Garl'lixxil.

Zard     (Sep 14 2022) [ 8047] cloud of daggers does dmg it seems but there is no indication of how much. I guess it might not be a bug it seems to me different than other spells like creeping doom, melt, or energy drain
