Fayris   (Feb 24 2011) [ 3042] imunity to heat keeps one from casting pyre on a target. this doesnt makes sense with the nature of the spell, as it's a buff cast on allies
Fayris   (Feb 24 2011) [ 6207] pyre needs to be allowed with consent
Flike    (Feb 24 2011) [ 6209] the target of pyre takes fire damage dispite negate heat. this should be fixed

Miasma   (Dec 16 2013) [48221] grouping with shapechanged druids is still really buggy.  if they're already grouped prior to shapechange, they cant group when shapechanged
Miasma   (Dec 18 2013) [53333] pretty sure freezing wind is bugged.  it does around 12 points of damage (as an 82 level cryo)

Mejna    (Jun 21 2019) [ 3022] My belt of potions seems to hold a LOT of gems. Maybe not a bug, but it seems like it is holding more than it should be able to hold - maybe it is magic?
Gizelle  (Jun 26 2019) [ 3002] Kind of a bug, but black cloak can only be worn on body, not about body. I think all other cloaks are about body, so this one should be renamed or given different wear location for consistency. I.E. can wear cloak over a robe, so rename it a robe or c
Gizelle  (Jun 26 2019) [ 3002] change its slots (finished from previous entry).
Mejna    (Jun 26 2019) [12164] A deer climbed the tree. They should probably stay under the trees.

Gennaire (Jul 07 2019) [ 3011] I sent a coin-studded, boiled woolen vest via mudmail to Naius, and she got the mail that said it was attached but she didn't get it.
Gizelle  (Jul 10 2019) [ 8714] This may be intentional, but badgers are aggressive, and the shopkeeper assists the badger if you are attacked in his room. This seems not quite right - shopkeep should assist the others
Mejna    (Jul 10 2019) [ 8713] Muleard sent me a tell, but my reply went to a badger.
Mejna    (Jul 10 2019) [ 8711] Blacksmith's Shop is not a shop. Even if he isn't selling something, should probably be able to do list here.

Mejna    (Jul 14 2019) [ 3044] oops, typo.
Meina    (Jul 14 2019) [ 3054] ruby splinter level is higher than Orb of Winds, but is pretty meh. Looks like level was raised on splinter (which used to be pretty low), without any stat bumps. Needs balancing.
Mejna    (Jul 19 2019) [58214] This room seems intended to be a one-way exit based on the description, but it currently allows the player to leave south as well.
Mejna    (Aug 12 2019) [58001] if you recite green-recall, it appears to recite the recall on itself instead of on yourself.

Gizelle  (Sep 10 2019) [ 8360] black cloak is worn in the 'on body' slot, instead of the 'about body' slot, where most cloaks are worn. So you end up wearing two cloaks, and no tunic or robe or anything, which seems weird.
